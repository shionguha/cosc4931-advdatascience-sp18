ZYaS2P5EmK9DANxGTV48Tw	De_Forest_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I really like both Chinese restaurants in town. This one has outstanding crab rangoon. Love the chicken with snow peas and mushrooms and General Tso Chicken. Food is always ready in 10 minutes which is accurate. Good place and they give you free pop.
qWHIBzDnJpX32D2NpTyRsw	Mc_Farland_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Best Chinese food madison! I've tried them all and make the 15 minute drive every week :-)
UB48XPeYsvvWzYXeV7WsaA	Mc_Farland_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Main Moon is hand's down my favorite place to grab Chinese in McFarland, but really anywhere. No matter what time of day, day of the week, or week of the year - it only takes 15 minutes to get your food. Freshly made each time too. Don't order from the pictures, order from you heart. The staff is so friendly, I'm thinking about proposing in the near future, as I hope to be a part of their family like they've been a part of mine. I just can't even talk about the lunch buffet, I'll start tearing up with how amazing the deal is. Andddd, I just shed a tear. Yum yum yum in my tum tum tum. Miss you, Main Moon xoxox
nFPe7kazeEVjPP7zgoK4Og	Mc_Farland_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Main Moon has the best lunch in McFarland, buffet style. Friendly service, gloriously large takeout menus, and sauces like no one else. Try their fried pork dumplings, crab Rangoon, or General Tso's. Their fried rice is legit. All portions are generous. Until secondary Moons are established, make your lunar landing as soon as you can. Delicious.
b_gnK6JS0BHardzlgdZoKg	Mc_Farland_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Leaps and bounds better than other chinese food in the Madison area. Their lunch buffet is a great value. The general tsao's is to die for. Don't miss out on this fantastic food.
VQ5ulvpbdtMG62G-6YZEsg	Middleton_WI WI Party_&_Event_Planning Asian_Fusion Event_Planning_&_Services Venues_&_Event_Spaces Restaurants 5_star	I think some of the best Chinese food in Madison. A little pricey but a few dishes always feeds me for at least two additional meals.
PtYEtgyiHYvNF2CcZ7v9Lg	Middleton_WI WI Party_&_Event_Planning Asian_Fusion Event_Planning_&_Services Venues_&_Event_Spaces Restaurants 5_star	We visit family in Madison at least twice a year and always make sure to have dinner here. The shrimp sizzling rice soup is absolutely to die for, and every entree I've had has been fabulous. Hands down the best Chinese food I have ever had.
Mv8xaRhWFbTLLIULmEuHfg	Middleton_WI WI Party_&_Event_Planning Asian_Fusion Event_Planning_&_Services Venues_&_Event_Spaces Restaurants 5_star	Lettuce wraps 3x better than PF Changs. If Yelp reviewers consider PF changs 3 stars, then this gets 5. Just to clear up for those who want authentic Chinese. Go to ICHIBAN NOW!!!
TvKHCDE5MdQEfCYqPcD14Q	Middleton_WI WI Party_&_Event_Planning Asian_Fusion Event_Planning_&_Services Venues_&_Event_Spaces Restaurants 5_star	Best Chinese food in the area. Great service and calming atmosphere.
cke8mgbsBkRsSjTEQU4FPg	Middleton_WI WI Party_&_Event_Planning Asian_Fusion Event_Planning_&_Services Venues_&_Event_Spaces Restaurants 5_star	Always consistently delicious! Classic preparations of Americanized Chinese. The cashew chicken is great!
xTUg5ZFk6-hqZExh-DGGvg	Middleton_WI WI Party_&_Event_Planning Asian_Fusion Event_Planning_&_Services Venues_&_Event_Spaces Restaurants 5_star	Hands down the best Chinese food in Madison. The chicken chow mein has been a favorite since I was a child. Try the egg rolls and the jasmine or chrysanthemum tea. You really can never go wrong here! The decor is beautiful, and makes you almost feel like you could be in a restaurant in China.
rM_V3OfrwWA7vHsXsUmq2w	Middleton_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Eclectic (but down-to-earth), Upbeat, Friendly, Inexpensive, Near-healthy (see menu), Kid-friendly, Fast, Clean, Variety. What more could one ask for?
Y_fMMHPz5Cs02WtSAQDlEg	Middleton_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	We LOVE this place. Food is excellent, service fast, huge portions, reasonable prices. Egg drop soup, spring rolls, bourbon chicken with veg fried rice--fantastic. You will not be sorry you visited. On nice evenings or lunches, eat outside .
XoSnoSVTlRAVaAkkVgwFuA	Middleton_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	We love Asia Fresh. bourbon chicken with veg fried rice-perfect. Take away done quickly. service great. Great price.
rUN9ZqKJAefqNSfv7g_xZg	Sun_Prairie_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I love this place. The fried dumplings are to die for.
aeOIc53aL7M5aNavBDc-qA	Sun_Prairie_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Easy on-line menu, great selection and fabulous food. I ordered hot/ sour soup, egg roll and chicken/ broccoli. All of it was great. I can't wait to go back.
eb_Wdmrvndad0Ww8eJFqUA	Sun_Prairie_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Every time my boyfriend and I eat here, it has been great. We really enjoy the steamed dumplings and hot and sour soup. The staff is very friendly, too.
cYsrFnnrqKsLuF1dNLvpHQ	Sun_Prairie_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Best chinese I've found so far. Hot and sour soup and their won ton soup are fantastic. Sometimes I'll go and just get the soup.
uJYuDKY6Yz3W9MIQCvRWSA	Sun_Prairie_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	The general tso's and boneless spare ribs are about as good as you'll find. No lie!
XHg0mfC31B3uIlJhotI8nA	Sun_Prairie_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I love this place. The food is always fresh, they keep an eye on the buffet so they can refill the trays quickly. I've never had anything here that wasn't great.
l6TrCZ51kfjQH0tBPCxSbw	Sun_Prairie_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I have been eating here for at least 7 years and it's excellent. Typically a group of us go there for lunch coming from work. I love the pepper chicken the broccoli and the chicken on a stick things. Ohh yes, the peanut butter chicken is also excellent. My 4 kids really love going there too when we happen to be in that area on a weekend. They've been going there every now and then since they were babies. I have heard that they may not be able to renew their lease as that part of the strip mall may be changed. That would be very disappointing. They have been a loyal staple spot for years while stores with in the mall have changed some of which are still vacant. If you have not checked them out give them a try. If you enjoy them go back for a visit incase they are soon gone.
DEw5my1Dnc02lUIZmGegRw	Sun_Prairie_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This restaurant was forced to close due to a greedy landlord that suddenly doubled their rent, probably because of the upgrades done with the new Walmart. Does anyone know where this family went or if they opened in another location? I would gladly go to the the one. I haven't found any Chinese food as good.
bHy3jFpjZpoci4ujWYZNaA	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	We go here religiously whenever we are craving Chinese take-out (which happens a lot!) I could imagine this place is overlooked but it seriously has some of the best food in town. Service is fast and the food comes out consistently great every time. Order the pork fried rice, you won't regret it.
a11GIjA9-Tw9SYVBZxjl5w	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Best take out Chinese in East Madison. Food is always fresh and well cooked. Sometimes you have to make sure they didn't forget the rice - mainly when the woman who typically works the front counter is not there. I have always found the service to be friendly. Periodically, I have even received free chicken dumplings or a soda. By far the best Moo Shu I have found in Madison after living here for 15 years and trying several of the more upscale places in town. FYI, there is a small seating area here but it is mainly a takeout place.
DfpClGSWBk8Y7Tg4FRnuNA	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This place was recommended to me as some of the best Chinese food in Madison. Totally agree! I went here for a Wednesday lunch at 2 pm and I was the only person there. I don't mean to be stereotypical, but if you've ever walked into an empty Chinese restaurant in the mid afternoon...you're probably going to have to make your presence known by ringing a bell or yelling an awkward "hello" towards the kitchen. Not in this case, I was promptly greeted and offered to sit anywhere. My food was excellent. Nothing daring, just general tso's chicken. Good sauce, good flavor, good consistency. Lunch doesn't get any better at $4.95 which includes an entree, rice, and soup! Summary: friendly service, awesome food, good prices. I'll be back.
LXFSqIJJwPRJ4UWCD9exqw	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Really great Chinese food. Something about this restaurant gives you the impression that the cooks and staff really care about your food. Everything is delicious and there's a sense that it's more 'homemade' than other Chinese restaurants.
QDNwJksTjDiG_Uroq8Qr7A	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I gotta say that the food from this restaurant is really good and the service is very nice. I came here and a lady served me and she also was very attentive. Price is always good when you're student.
oS6SCGftPFWad4xzpyRQvw	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	After reading all the reviews i was really hesitant on going to this restaurant. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by since we were craving Chinese and decided to sit in the bar. Obviously everyone has a different opinion but this place was amazing! First off, the hostess was adorable and incredibly sweet. The bartender was amazing and he made us feel right at home. And the owner of the restaurant seemed like the sweetest lady in the world. The decor was what I would expect from a Chinese restaurant but they made the restaurant feel classy and not cheap. I ordered the pepper steak no tomatoes and my boyfriend got pork egg foo young. Wow is all I can say. The beef actually tasted like real fresh meat! Not the rubber fake kind you get at other cheap takeouts. The only draw back i had was that the peppers and onions were cut pretty big but that wasn't a huge issue. My boyfriends egg foo young was like none other and they sure didn't hold back on the sauce! The pork inside was actually Chinese bbq pork and it sure added a kick. Overall, the prices are a tad bit high but worth every penny! All the workers and the owner are so helpful and you can tell they really appreciate their customers. This is definitely my #1 stop for Chinese on the east side!
X0yaivQtEFJm80zaGy-GlQ	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Hands down my favorite place for Chinese food in Madison. Consistency is key for me and IG is always consistent. The pace is slower than some restaurants, but it's worth the extra time. We eat here at least 4-5 times a year and it's always a great night with great service. Cashew Chicken, egg roll, shrimp rangoon and a glass of wine = LOVE!
xNTf99Ezm9k0R4cVBTFmCA	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Good food, good service and clean. I had the cashew chicken, my wife had the general tsao's chicken and my son had chicken fried rice. All were very good. My only complaint, and it is very minor, is that the chairs have wheels. It is very easy to scoot yourself around unexpectedly. I will definitely return the next time I am in Madison.
ZfbF_tBNRzRwnX4bpuHtGQ	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I really don't know what happened with all of the negative reviewers. We've been coming to Imperial Garden since 1997. We've tried other places, but this place is easily the best for Chinese food anywhere in the area. Chicken & Broccoli, Beef Lo-mein, Stir fried rice noodles, steamed pot stickers, & the chicken egg foo young are all great! General Tso's is good too. Staff is very friendly, many have been working there for 10+ years, and we are remembered when we come in- a nice touch. We've been to the westside location as well. Good, but not as good as East, if you ask me. If you don't believe me, take a look at the wall in the lobby. They've won best in Madison nearly every year since 1987! How many restaurants around now can say the same thing??
hHRl3EgOJyLNVX1NVXTChg	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	My husband and I returned to Imperial Garden for dinner with our children. We were there on a Friday night. There was a bit of a wait (about 20 min), but nothing out of the ordinary for a Friday night around 5:30 pm. We had another great experience. We found IG family friendly and able to accommodate our two children without disturbing any other guests. Our five year old loved the experience and the food as well. And as parents know, if your children are happy, you are happy. We ordered the (very affordable I might add) lo mein for our daughter. It was good and there were plenty of leftovers between the lo mein and the two entrees we ordered.
KTzVU_HAMBgwiIfiZw6C5Q	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Try the shrimp egg foo young. It is the best ever. The shrimp fried rice is great, good with vegetables. Don't forget the bar. A lot of people like to stop in. The bartender is friendly, just like the show Cheers. You can order and eat at the bar if you want. The manager Rose is elegant and full of laughter. No worries at this place.
UwRCKuL7rnwV4biD7qYAig	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Best Chinese food in Midwest. I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, and the quality here matches any Chinese restaurant back home!
ra_oKruGk7ySlejjY-Hx7A	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This place gets top marks from me. The food was delicious and prices are very favorable. The service was very polite and prompt. I asked to add tofu (NOT fried) to my eggplant/Thai basil dish. Normally I get arguments about not frying my tofu (I really, really don't care for fried), but not here. The chef expertly prepared my meal. The seasoning and sauce was really nice. The sauce was just the right amount. If I had to say one thing... the rice was a little sticky, but I can totally see past that because the overall meal was just great. I enjoyed the left overs the next day.
QoAN7Wn1_rCt6GxsN8Qjog	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Great food, . fast. We carry out from there at least once a month, sometimes more.
bbgZbFGcXdALGiILRdFH6w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Food Specialty_Food Fruits_&_Veggies Ethnic_Food 5_star	Buying a new bike can be a big decision. Buying a gimmicky electric bike could be a bad decision. Buying electronics from a produce market could be questionable decision. And lastly buying anything over $500 from a place that is located south of downtown, cash only, and offers no warranties/returns... seems to put the nail in the coffin for logical decisions. But some how myself and dozens of other logical people have had a excellent to OK experience when doing all of the above. Phoenix Produce is selling Fujiton E-Bikes straight off the boat from China. And we're not talking "Made in China" hidden in some innocuous spot; this is legitimately Chinese...from the oddly sized tires (which makes it a little difficult to find tubes for) to the Mandarin/Cantonese (not actually sure which) that fills the instrument panel and indicator lights. Phoenix Produce carries two models 36v and 48v both have max speed of 20 MPH. While they differ in range 22 miles and 30 miles, respectively, on a single charge. The motor definitely has good torque for a little electric motor...I've heard the 48v is even better than my 36v. Both plug directly into a 110V (normal) outlet. The 36v costs a little more than 3 CENTS per charge. These are bikes, so you can ride them on sidewalks or other bike designated paths. No license/registration/insurance/helmet required (legally per ARS 28-2516)...though the helmet is recommended. As for the no warranties and returns part...I can only say what I've experienced. Sam, the owner of Phoenix Produce, has been very good to me in all my dealings. I had some initial problems with the battery and charger of the bike, making the first week of ownership less than stellar. Fortunately, I talked to Sam about those issues and he corrected the problems no charge...sure seemed like a warranty; but Jenny, one of his employees, said "He is just really fair." And I have to agree. For the price you cannot beat them approximately $500 a little higher or lower depending on the model of your choice.
l3DIAANr7H0JMJ9BwzxFhw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Wow. I've been reading the other reviews and I'm honestly shocked. I've been coming here since it first opened and no one knew anything about it. I liked it better when it was small and unknown, but that's because I could enjoy it at my leisure. The owner would often come out and chat up the customers and the business in a house was a fairly new phenomenon. The food has been consistently tasty and fairly priced. The only thing to change over the years is the architecture and decor. I've taken all sorts of people here to eat and no one has ever disagreed that it was the best Chinese food. I have always had at least adequate service on First Fridays. The rest of the time, the service is as wonderful as the food.
szaJZfnJ060rnsXrFbzrHQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I heard about this guy Sarah K. went out with on 12/12. They didn't quite click, but he sounded up my alley. We totally hit it off and had all kinds of romantic dinners and wild nights. Then we got married and made tons of babies and they all grew up to become supreme court justices. This is how I feel about Fate.
kMKcALEBS4z05DY-sCFdHA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said about Fate, but here goes. The food at Fate is like a warm spicy Asian orgasm on a plate. The martinis send me to another level of heaven. Johnny Chu is a genius and I will cry if he ever leaves Phoenix. I think that about covers it.
bkRJnvnBuqsiAoaQA-cwYA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I was actually pretty shocked to see any negative reviews for Fate on here. The whole bun scenario listed a few reviews down sounds like a fiasco, but thankfully i've never had a negative experience there, and i've been there god only knows how many times. Fate is my favorite restaurant. i discovered it late one night (well, early morning, actually) after helping a friend shoot a burlesque show downtown. I was amazed that they were open that late (I think it was one...maybe two A.M.?). He insisted that I'd be amazed, and I was. I have had to wait a few times to get in, but usually that was because it was First Friday. It's understandable, because it's a small place (like most of the places downtown), and it's pretty popular. Besides, you can always call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait. It's not a big deal. The service the first time and each subsequent visit was excellent, and the food was brought out ridiculously fast. The crab puffs are to die for, and I honestly have trouble narrowing down which martini is the best. The pad thai martini is just amazingly weird enough to be good, but the spicy cucumber is out of this world. I've tried a number of dishes, but I always come back to the spicy Saigon with shrimp. I'm glad I don't live nearby, or I'd go there all the time. This way it's always a treat when I go.
5VSL_KgPmidNaDmW82b3PA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I love Fate! LOVE it. I love Fate so much, sometimes I want to take it behind the school and get it pregnant! Their green tea milk is AMAZING. I go cuckoo for it. For reals! Their little mushrooms are so good too. Oh my god, they are like little mini mushrooms. If keebler elf's, harvested mushrooms, these would be it! So good! If it's your first time, trust me: get the crab puffs, grab yourself a cool refreshing hulk-alishist Green Tea Milk, and go for the Hong Kong flat noodles. So good! And what about those little wafer cookies they give you at the end? They are like air! But better! (...they have calories...maybe they are not like air...but in a perfect world? Like Air!)
fQ_QFNfPS5heqAXzCGgEyg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This is by far my favorite restaurant ever. I have been coming to Fate for about five years now and never ONCE have I been disappointed with the food or the atmosphere. We are normally pretty lucky and we get Heather who is SUPER sweet and a great waitress. I see reviews about people complaining about the hostess. Yeah, they can be snobby and make life difficult but it is SO worth it. I would 100% recommend the hot and sour soup. It is amazing. Unfortunately I recently found out it has SHRIMP POWDER so I cannot eat it any more. Another tasty veggie friendly appetizer is the tofu wedges. They come with an amazing peanut sauce. I have had several entrees, but always come back to the Hong Kong Flat Rice with fried tofu. It is so amazing. Garlicy sauce. They have really amazing yellow curry too. They might put brown sugar in it because it is a little sweet, but perfectly so. The portions are always great, and you honestly CANNOT beat the atmosphere. It is an old house in the historic district turned restaurant and they display artwork from local artists. Stay away during artwalk though, or you will have to wait forever for a table. They are open really late on the weekends too. At least give Fate a shot once. If you don't like it I will let you punch me in the gut.
JWthvREX3d3X9OhjbhVKiA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I must say Fate was the only positive thing I gained from an otherwise awful date. The food was fantastic. I had the green chicken curry. It had the perfect mixture of spices and it was not too spicy for a curry dish. I wasn't expecting the curry sauce to be creamy. The sauce had a light green split pee hue, but despite the odd color the flavor was amazing. The meals were fairly priced. I believe my dinner was around the same price as my first drink...$10.00-$12.00. I enjoyed the artistic ambiance. The staff was polite and our food and drinks were delivered to us promptly. I have read other reviews about the hostess's being rude...luckily I haven't experienced that. Even if I had e negative staff experience I would still recommend Fate for the food alone.
pc_FaGliHaxRwzCjWdc5bw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Love it. Hole-in-the-wall with Peking duck on demand. Try the greens and the snapper sauteed with ginger and scallions. Great noodles, too.
85rurtJd6YKKhIXRvIQgRg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I crave this place, I dream of their Peking Duck. Better than sex, well maybe not better, but a close runner up. Went here with J.W. and a number of other friends for my birthday; great fun, fantastic food! Don't let the hoody decor scare you off, experience the Gourmet House!
7TtLOfJz0bmrg3j5G-sWCA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This great family run restaurant is a fantastic restaurant-- authentic Chinese, served at bargain prices. The decor sucks, the lights are fluorescent, and there is a huge bill board in the parking lot. BUT, if you can look past some of its physical failings, the food is fantastic. Always dependable, always tasty. The menu is HUGE...
ab_YKDmdSsXnYM0MTX9v8g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Having lived in the neighborhood for eight years, I can't say much other than: variety, reliable, authentic. But what I'm really compelled to tell you all about is... They now serve Thai! In addition to their already huge menu! The Chicken Pad Thai is arguably the best I've ever had (I've had it in New York and San Francisco). Its crazy how good it is... I had to have it two days in a row to confirm. I've had the green curry and that was yummy - fresh veggies in everything, crispy and plentiful. IMHO, their decor rocks! I love the cheesy waterfall in the front, the chairs with coffee cup designs and giant turntable-centered family-sized tables. The green walls are an upgrade from the pink and blue that was there before. Go to Fate if you want to sit in faux-modern Ikea surroundings. This place is classic Mc Do Well
buE-dL4Pl_MWYZ-HhBpc3A	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Adam M. was absolutely right: The Chinese Broccoli in Garlic Sauce and the Mixed Seafood Hot Pot (Casserole) are really, really amazing! I've also become a big fan of the Tomato Sauce Shrimp - tastes nothing like what you're thinking. Eat these items we recommend or be seriously disappointed trying the chinese staples you've become brainwashed into enjoying elsewhere.
8w_FyfEzIkbczZj5ova0dw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Great authentic Hong Kong food. I don't like all of the food they serve, but the stuff I order is the exceptional. This is one of those "hole in the wall" places with great food. I highly recommend the Chow Fun, the Hunan Beef, ginger and green onion snapper (fried)... This is one of my favorite spots.
AI7I-W_BiHLYuLScoNYLyg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I would like to make my rating based on three things: Food quality, customer service and consistency. I've tried MANY asian food establishments here in the valley since moving here three years ago and this is by far the best I've had! I usually order To Go and my food is always ready before I get there and am greeted with a kind hello and an appreciative smile (how nice!). I've ordered from them many times and have been impressed everytime. Thank you for the great food!!
XLdbHY5j0KAbiUOkLsqApQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I really don't understand all the complaints about this place. I've been going here for years, and the food has always been solid, cheap, quick and really tasty. The menu is huge, and I have no complaints about the service or cleanliness of the place, either. I usually get the fried tofu with garlic sauce. It's transcendent. Crispy, delicious triangles of fried tofu and a fantastic mushroom-garlic-onion sauce with some brown rice....I have dreams about it. If I have the cash, I'll get some spring rolls with spicy mustard, which are a hot, crispy delight. Haters gonna hate, I guess. I just wish it was open all night!
E20_NPvqbHLLIZEHpUdP1w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I am a native New Yorker where the best Chinese food exists in almost every corner. There is no such thing as bad Chinese food in NY. I tried the chinese food here and it is EXCELLENT. Had the egg drop soup and the won ton soup. The wonton soup was off the charts. Wonderful flavorful broth with a truly meaty wonton with very light dough. Amazing. Also had the chicken with honey walnuts. I couldn't believe the amount of walnuts given as well as the lightness of the batter. We also had beef chow fun with gravy. As good as it gets. Of course the place is not upscale but I didn't go there to eat the walls, tablecloths or the booths. It's a place with delicious food and good value. The people were all very personable and polite. They answered the many questions we had since it was our first time there. We also had dessert. The darkest chocolate ice cream I have seen in a long time. Yummy. All this for under $25. Can you believe it? Get there!
sfqmuVJ3aa_UwrsPVqHoBg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	After a few recommendations, I finally paid a visit to this restaurant. I'm glad I did because it was really great! The building isn't the nicest but the food certainly makes up for it. I ordered a few dishes for our family. The Beef Chow Fun was my favorite. This noodle dish has really great flavor. We also ordered the Mongolian beef and Chicken with Garlic sauce; both were fantastic! Our last dish that we ordered was the Green Curry with Chicken. This was also good, a little spicy and a little sweet. Overall, our meal was really good and we will definitely be coming back here again.
9pbzezGIpZeu_Yo3lwX8lw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I have driven 7 hours to eat here! i am Chinese and have lived in SF so I have had my fair share of Chinese food. This is the real deal. My wife and I stumbled upon this place 4 years ago. We have literally made trips to Phoenix from New Mexico for the food at GHK. Food is consistent, authentic and just damn good. Be careful, I am pretty sure the staff and chefs customizes your food. If you are non Asian and order sweet and sour pork and egg foo young, you will probably get Americanized Chinese food. Our favorites are the lobster with ginger and scallions, satay fish pan fried noodles, walnut shrimp and beef chow fun. Ask the waitress for authentic Chinese. And tell them the Fat Chinese guy from New Mexico sent you. :)
6Rf99EYHdE8mLOZFpb2HRw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I have been a loyal customer here for 15 years. The staff and food are great. The prices cant be beat, especially during lunch hours. A great variety of food from seafood to vegetarian to meat and poultry dishes. This is truly a Phoenix gem!!
RmyIA7Y_Wo87ULBSvv6xGw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I love their NOODLES! Try the Shanghai Noodles with vegetables (order it dry).
oXhv4wcEt1jpfdSE8C5TRg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Great authentic Hong Kong food. I don't like all of the food they serve, but the stuff I order is the exceptional. This is one of those "hole in the wall" places with great food. I highly recommend the Chow Fun, the Hunan Beef, ginger and green onion snapper (fried)... This is one of my favorite spots. Updated: We have been visiting this place once or twice a week and we are still loving it. I just added sesame chicken to the rotation and it is also amazing. We love this place.
tDvgZc-XGCINeusVyMBJ9A	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	My wife and I lived in Bangkok, Thailand for four years while on assignment for the American Embassy. While there we were exposed to all levels, including the finest, in Chinese cuisine. A few years after retiring we moved to Phoenix and, for one reason or another, have been disappointed in the quality of Chinese cuisine found here. That is, until last Sunday when we accepted a recommendation to try The Gourmet House of Hong Kong with friends. We ordered several of the soups and entrees. Prices were reasonable, service was excellent and all items were quickly served piping hot. This first experience here brought back wonderful memories of the lengthy time we spent in Asia. Items we ordered were Wonton Soup, Hot and Sour Soup, Green Curry Pork Clay Pot, Egg Rolls, Crab Puffs, Kung Pao Shrimp, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Peking Duck and Almond Chicken. All were authentic in quality and flavor and will most surely be ordered and enjoyed again as we continue to explore the restaurant's lengthy menu. This restaurant receives our best recommendation.
Mxffh4_E0874RJ5FQtc4fQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I know this place got a few nasty reviews, but I think they probably went in for the lunch, which unfortunately isn't as awesome as their dinner. The dinner is consistently delicious, the egg rolls are obviously made there and not frozen. Last time we went there we got the cashew chicken (amazing) and the sweet and sour chicken (pretty good) along with egg drop soup which is great too. They don't use msg, and one of the waitresses even took the time to talk to us for a while, they're always pretty nice. It may look like a hole in the wall, but those seem to be the best places to get a good plate of Chinese food.
teBl71zKJD4n9naX90PNYw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Well to tell you every time I come here is amazingly awesome, never had a problem with there food or service. People just need to chill with the bad reviews. Also not just the food is great but their deserts are delicious! Mango with white rice and cream is a must try!
_KXZEj3h4fBhcJiSS4j14A	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Great food... Had red curry chicken with rice, egg rolls, raggoons... And hot&sour soup... All but the soup was above average in taste!! The hot and sour soup has a strong vinegar taste, not a fan of.
-R7aMgkRAxMJwkw3Tp2oBw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Food Grocery 5_star	Support the Asian Invasion and shop at this place. Mad mad props to a great Asian market in an area like this. My family and I always lived in areas where there weren't many Asians around when I was growing up. We could never find what we needed for our dishes. Now I live in SF home of all Asian goodness. This place gives me hope that should I move away from SF that I will be able to find places where little Chinese girls like me can fill my food cravings for dried baby clams, fish balls, sashimi etc. This place is also way cleaner than most markets I've seen. With very reasonable prices. Great selection of everything you need from produce, meats, dried, and frozen products. Also has a deli that I swear could be in the heart of Chinatown. Love love and love. I heart asian supermarkets.
5raX8dzyQzyIIxwtx13T3w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Food Grocery 5_star	While visiting the Phoenix area, we checked out their 'Chinatown'. Small as it is, I was surprise to find a 99 Ranch Mkt. Coming from the Bay Area I wasn't at awe with the store; its typical like all other 99 Ranch I've shopped at. It received a 5 star because of its location in the Chinese Cultural Center plaza which is cool to explore.
MoMAGGNJpgnyz0PWO81KZw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Shopping_Centers Shopping Outlet_Stores Chinese Restaurants 5_star	It's unique and it's in Phoenix, for that alone it gets 5 stars. This is a fun place to kill a couple of hours with out of town visitors or on a date. Stroll through the gardens. Wander through the grocery store, (yes it stinks but it's part of the ambiance) and look a all the strange and gross foods. Try one of the restaurants, but not Quizno's that doesn't count. Check out the curio shops for some odd trinket to take home with you.
c1zu1pAORE51y-9F91ULZw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Shopping_Centers Shopping Outlet_Stores Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This place is essentially a strip mall, but offers more than the usual strip mall options. The biggest attraction is its architecture, as its designed with traditional Chinese architecture. The top floors hold office space, the bottom retail and restaurant space. Facing 44th Street is a beautiful garden. There's a large goldfish pond on the south side,with small bridges and walkways over and around it. There are numerous statues and pagodas along the south and east side of the building. It's a beautiful and relaxing addition to the city. There is a large store that sells Asian goods, namely furniture and decorative items. The owners are very nice and friendly. There is also a bridal gown shop and Asian video store next to it. Ranch Market owns a large grocery store that sells Asian foods, though in my opinion LeeLee Market in Chandler has a better selection. There are several restaurants and a coffee shop as well. The Golden Buddha is excellent and the wait staff moves fast. During the day, you can order dim sum from carts the wait staff pushes around the dining floor. The food is excellent and you may be able to get a seat overlooking the aforementioned goldfish pond. It's definitely worth a trip.
GfMb2WHPCkUv7RST_L3lqw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Shopping_Centers Shopping Outlet_Stores Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I love visiting the Chinese Cultural Center. There's a really cool replica garden and quite a few restaurants. I'm always drawn to the Ranch Market full of Asian goodies. This market reminds me of the stores I used to frequent in Seattle/Tacoma. I haven't actually eaten at any of the restaurants there yet, but it's coming. What a great place to go check out something different and check out some new foods in the market.
t1xwwMtusN3z9TEGa2SPZQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Shopping_Centers Shopping Outlet_Stores Chinese Restaurants 5_star	5 stars for the fact that Phoenix even has a Chinese Cultural Center area. The only place I've been to in it is the grocery store but one day, I plan to check-out the lil gardens and restaurants. Can't wait until they get more in there! (Don't go expecting a big Chinatown-like scene.) The take-out from inside the grocery store is pretty tasty, inexpensive and fast! See ya there!
91wBSecep9mbzekVRpysjw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Shopping_Centers Shopping Outlet_Stores Chinese Restaurants 5_star	The Ranch Market is the ONLY place I have been able to find that has had my miniature money tree!! I have looked all over the Untied States since my last one died with no luck until today. Needless to say I was absolutely thrilled beyond belief!!! I must also give them credit for promptly returning my lost LV wallet! THANK YOU for being honest!!! =) The import store over next to the Golden Buddha has a great selection of different Chinese figurines, Buddhas, furniture, bamboo, fountains, miniature tea sets, Hung Bao, etc... Always a joy to go in there and browse around. Last time I walked out of there $200 poorer!! hehehe Check it out. It's a small complex but lots of browsing fun. Enjoy.
h0i59qGte_I28VdAeTZeUQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Shopping_Centers Shopping Outlet_Stores Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I like that there are a few restaurants in this center. And one in the Market too, which a while ago changed ownership to the store (vs. 3rd party vendor). The food choices got slim, and were less fresh, but they seem to have that all fixed as of recently. So I am going there almost weekly again.
jOOaI3DYkHg9BPEUzaoWHQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Shopping_Centers Shopping Outlet_Stores Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This place is awesome, I like coming here and going to the shops and looking at all sorts of diff things
VMWVPa2b1mJKCZaCFBQEZw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Shopping_Centers Shopping Outlet_Stores Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Check out the Dorayaki at the Ranch Market, if you get there on time, they make a red bean paste pancake on a griddle in front of the store. Deelish! Go to the Szechwan Palace and request the non-English menu for the true authentic items. The gift shop has tons of gift ideas if you are stumped. I might also mention they have some really, really nice shrines made out of cherry wood and lacquer. I was in the market for one to make my altar and these are the real deal. Beautiful furniture finds, although they can be a bit pricey. They are willing to negotiate with you if you ask. The store has what you need but the variety may seem lacking in comparison to Lee Lee's or Mekong. Anything you try at the bakery is amazing, if you are in the mood for perfect deco-den like whipped cream cakes, this is the place to get it. Their fruit selection is lacking which is probably my only gripe, but they make up for it in their vegetable selection. The Chinese Herb shop next door is a great place if you are into holistic/Chinese medicine. I wish this place was bigger with more stores, that would definitely put it over the top.
UpmC05r-2ZjK7R-yZuS8yQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Shopping_Centers Shopping Outlet_Stores Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Bread grill pork bun, taste as good as always!
UMkmKztAReZiEG4DwnvV7Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	We eat here a lot and I realized I haven't put a review in of this place. This is hands down one of the yummiest offerings at the Chinese Cultural Center. We've been to all the places in this complex, but for repeatable quality, good prices, and service, this is the best one. The servings are (IMO) three per entree. So when you go and you traditionally think one entree per person be warned! Expect to share. The hot and spicy soup is consistently one of the best in Phoenix. The Pork buns perfect, the best General Tao's I've been able to find, and large scallop and shrimp in the meals that feature them. I have not found a meal here that I regret ordering. The kitchen will work with you if you have special requests and they will not leave your drinks languishing. After approximately 20 visits, they have never gotten an order or a bill wrong. The place doesn't have many people eating in it when I've gone usually Chinese people though. Once in awhile the place is quite full, but the best news is they are open EVERY DAY until 9:30. They are not upset when you arrive close to 9pm. Szechuan cooking is quite delightful here and I'll pick it over closer options any day of the week. I'm sorry I haven't Yelped them. They have been around for 10 years in this location and you should give them a try, especially if you are headed over to Ranch Market afterwards. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
hCyPvUV3_zM_5ZpyGjqUcQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Chinese food has become so Americanized that it's easy to forget (or never know) about the flavors and preparation styles that characterize authentic and regionally-specific Chinese food. A few months ago, I had a great experience learning about authentic Sichuan from Helen Y when she invited me to join her at Szechwan Palace in the Chinese Cultural Center, and this past weekend, she invited my husband and me, along with some other very fortunate Yelpers, including David S B, Jason W, and Alexander C, to eat some more amazing and authentic Chinese at Lao Ching Hing (according to her review, their Chinese menu features mostly Shanghainese food with some Sichuan dishes and a few Cantonese dishes). Just as at Szechwan Palace, the atmosphere of the restaurant was nothing special. In fact, it was a little messy, at least in the little area with the large round table where they sat us - we were surrounded by all of these rows of boxes and random containers. Oh, well - atmosphere aside, the service was friendly and prompt (our waters were always kept full), and the food was incredible. So that you are able to order some more authentic items, I'll give you a breakdown of what Helen ordered for us off the Chinese menu (which she has so generously translated and posted to the business info section of this review): *Cold jellyfish in scallion oil - This had a nice semi-chewy texture (reminded me of octupus) and a vinegary sauce. Reminded me of kim chi, which I love. *Wok-fried rice cakes - Little oval noodles (same texture as Chow Fun) in a savory light sauce with fresh, crunchy vegetables *1/2 crispy duck - Tender meat with crispy skin; served with Hoisin sauce *"Ants Climbing Up a Tree" - Unusual name but tasty dish. It was vermicelli (thin noodles) with a minced meat and chili sauce. *Whole salt and pepper shrimp - These were crispy and had the perfect amount of salt and pepper coating. The shrimp themselves were a little fishy, though. Highly recommend eating them whole (including the eyes!) *Beef tendon and tripe in scallion oil - I wasn't wild about the texture, but the spicy sauce was really savory and flavorful. *Soup dumplings - Little dumplings filled with soup broth that you have to eat in one big bite. They were good, but I preferred the ones that we had at Szechwan Palace. *Fish pieces w/ sauce - I could be wrong, but I think these were the "spicy soybean paste with sliced fish" from the menu. They were very bony and difficult to eat, but I enjoyed the flavor. *Peking spare ribs - Delicious! Had the most savory sauce and really tender meat. *Drunken chicken - Not a huge fan of this dish. The chicken was a bit dry, instead of falling off the bone, and the skin wasn't crispy at all. *Chopped Shanghainese greens with tofu in sesame oil - Served cold. Was really flavorful and light and would be great as a vegetarian appetizer. *Sauteed "snake" gourd with soy beans - To the best of my knowledge, this consisted of pieces of sauteed squash with soy beans in a clear, mild sauce. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was the perfect complement. *Steamed and deep-fried bun - This came in the shape of a long roll that we had to cut into individual pieces. It was delicious doughy and slightly crispy on the outside and was fabulous dipped in some chili sauce. *Green onion pancake - This has always been one of my favorite authentic Chinese dishes and has a wonderful mealy texture. Again, excellent dipped in chili sauce! *Deep-fried shredded potato - Being that we went at 11:30 on a Sunday, my eye was drawn to this hash-brown-like dish. Didn't regret my choice because it was delicious. Comprised of undercooked and crunchy potato slices in a sauce with chiles. One note - nothing we got was ridiculously spicy, but the chili sauce that comes on the table allows you to spice everything to taste and added flavor (and not just mind-numbing heat) to every dish I tried. 15 dishes! I may have forgotten to mention a dish or two, but as you can see, we had a veritable Shanghai feast! In this day and age, feasts usually cost a pretty penny, but the 9 of us walked out having only spent $20 each. Paying that little money for so much incredible and authentic food is just freaking incredible. I guarantee that my husband and I will be back!
kbaD16y2Jf5-jHHc6EgbeQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Great authentic Chinese menu. Thank you Helen for translating the menu! My significant other will be able to go there & order off the Chinese menu now! I like the rice cakes. Also a vegetarian dish with lima beans in it. Not quite sure of exact translation to English what it is. The staff is always friendly.
vFX3raAkep6PmTemBJHU7Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This is my parents' favorite place to eat when they come to Phoenix so we dropped by twice on our family vacation. The owner/proprietress convinced my mom (in mandarin) to let her pick the dishes for our first dinner so we didn't even know what would be coming. The cold smoked duck was sooo delish as was the special mountain leafy green with bean curd shreds (all minced fine and not on the regular menu). There was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo (excellent) and a pickled vegetable with fish soup. The soup wasn't really my thing because it was heavily seasoned with white pepper which I hate but the rest of my family said it was exceptional. Our second visit was for lunch before heading off to the airport for the return trip. I could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish. Luckily, we ordered two orders of fried potstickers because those were delicious as well. We also had some tasty steamed pork buns but I was stuffed at that point. If you really want to experience authentic shanghai food, let the staff order for you, you won't regret it.
KcRL8b49eOiQbi0S5j-MOg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I'm an out of towner and came to this Chinese Strip mall, seeing the Ranch Market, I knew I was in the right place. There was another restaurant called Golden Buddha next store, I decided on Lao Ching Hing based on the authentic decor, the smell of pepper outside the restaurant, and the menu selection. I was looking for a Fish Fillet in Spicy Sauce and a Hot and Sour Soup. Both were of highest quality. I was impressed by the taste and the quality of ingredients. I hate fatty meats and excessive oil, and Lao Ching Hing prepared both dishes to my likening. I am writing this review because there was hardly anybody in the restaurant when I came in, and I believe this place should be packed. In addition, they have a review listed on the tables which I consider ok, but not exceptional. The food is priced reasonably and of great quality, it doesn't get better than that for me.
F6XhgkwNvTOE5Ynyk2rPDQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This is where you go when you want REAL Chinese food. At least as close as your going to get in Phoenix. I think understanding this place will help determine if you want to go here. I'm pretty sure many of the poor reviews are because, folks are expecting American Chinese food when they go to the restaurant. American Chinese food is not anything your going to find in the many regions and cuisine cultures in China. I've spent a fair amount of time in China and their dishes are as close as I've been able to find to actually replicating dishes that I saw in China. Though I sadly miss spicy frog dishes in china, they have a chicken version here. (ie. please add spicy froggy!!! hint hint) They have classics like preserved egg, wonderful Chinese veggies, etc. There are a few sweet and sour, Kung Pao type dishes for folks wanting American Chinese food or with guests that want something more familiar. It's clearly family owned and they take pride in their business. Try the cucumbers! That's something anyone would love!
a4n58nAQfxGBnDzGRaDzzA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This is my favorite Chinese Joint in Az. The owner Margeritta is very polite. They have a Huge menu. and the best part is everything is REAL! Nice atmosphere for a nice family dinner, quick lunch, or a date. This is the best joint and beats out all of the other places at the Chinese Cultural Center by far. If you haven't gone here do it.
O7oCUy75fQoKgHjYo8BoUg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This place is always excellent. It's the closest to the food I've had in China that I've eaten in all of Phoenix. Particular favorite is the preserved egg. If your lucky you can get them to serve it to you sliced like is done in China. Though it's good in their tofu dish as well. They used to offer Chinese and Americanized Chinese on the same menu, but, now if you wish the Chinese version of dishes you need to request the Chinese menu.
xoLMg4lKHJhgy3y-df_bBA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Here is the deal. You have to ask for the Chinese menu. I am not saying this is right but if you are anything other than Chinese, they will hand you the "American" menu. DO NOT GO THERE!! Ask for the Chinese menu. This is the BEST Chinese restaurant that I have eaten at in the states. I lived in China for a year and this is truely authentic western China food. I spent a couple months in Sichuan province in the west and you are getting exactly what is served there. Try the "yu xiang rou si" literally translated, fish smelling small pieces of meat. It is julienned pork in a wonderful sauce that DOES NOT have any fish flavor or smell at all. It is SO good. One of my favs. Also try the julienned potato with green pepper, wonderful!! Ma Po Dou Fu is very traditional of the Sichuan province and known all over the country. These guys make it right using the star anise which gives heat and a numbing quality of the mouth. If this happens, it is authentic. You will know what I mean when you have it. Sichuan food is a bit oily which is authentic, a chile oil to warm them, since in the west up in the mountains that lead up to Tibet (known as the Gateway to Tibet) where the winters are very cold.
-gE7feEfM_N7LRagOY8Dxw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I'm going to make this short. 1. This is not your typical chinese restaurant. 2. They serve Sichuan styled food, and their american menu indeed sucks. 3. If you like sichuan styled food, this is a great place to go. Unfortunately it is not the best for anything else but they offer what they have very well (if you know what to expect).
7gkNz6HPXqCKKZIxn_oMzg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	(The food I order here is tongue-numbingly spicy and may include parts of the animal normally eaten by Andrew Zimmern) I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this review. I came here with some of my classmates one evening after class at ASU. Luckily, two of them were native Mandarin speakers, as well as my professor having lived in China for a couple of years, so they were all business when it came down to ordering food. Since going to this restaurant, I am addicted. There is no other word for it. My friend and I go at least once a week where we order the same things. In fact, we go so often that we are immediately seated at the same table by the staff, and sometimes not even given menus. What do we eat? We eat: cold noodles (liang fen), fuqi feipian (cold spicy beef tripe, tongue, and other parts), and water-boiled beef (we ask for it extra-spicy). After numbing your mouth, I suggest taking a sip of water OR ordering a Tsingtao beer. You'll be amazed at how sweet tasting the beer is! I am moving out of the Phoenix area to New England soon, and I am more than distraught that I will no longer be able to enjoy Szechuan Palace. I've threatened to kidnap the chef, but I'm not sure he'd enjoy being stored in my kitchen. One of the main suggestions for this restaurant is: DO NOT ORDER THE ORANGE CHICKEN. (hint: it's not really chinese food) Instead, ask one of the servers what the chef's special is for the day. Or, try out one of my fave dishes. You won't be disappointed!
K9LGTnNKRrbvvpaUjsFmVw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	If you like spicy food, this Sichuan spot has your name written all over it! Known as one of the Four Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine, Sichuan food can be described as spicy, hot, fresh and fragrant. When you are seated, if you are white, they will give you the "Whitey Menu". Politely ask for the "Zhangguó cài dan" or "Chinese Menu" and you will be presented with a nice, leather bound, menu filled with the best this place has to offer. I have tasted about 9 dishes from this place and each one was excellent. A word of warning, their hottest dishes are the "Water Boiled xxxxx" dishes literally drowning in mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns and can be a challenge for even the most seasoned spicy food lovers. I believe they have toned it down a bit (I was actually told this by a 10-year vetran of this spot) and the last time I had it, it was significantly less spicy, but still about a 9 - 10 on a 10pt spicy scale. Previously it was essentially inedible to my Nordic tongue, this last time it was enjoyable.... so buyer beware. I was going to go 4 stars, actually about 4.5, but given the fact that there is not a better Sichuan spot in AZ, it gets 5 stars. Go, eat, enjoy.
BbgossboS50IchFeiNzJaw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I won't repeat what has already been said but there has been some myths that need clarifying 1. Both the Chinese and Americanized menus are written in English including the description of the dishes. Also, you can ask the waiter to explain the specials. You don't have to speak Chinese or be Chinese to know the specials. After dining here, I realize some people want to sound unique or VIP but trust me, you don't have to be Chinese to taste all the dishes. That is B.S. 2. The Yelp photos donated by members make the dishes appear larger than they are. Most of the sauteed dishes like the Kung Pao chicken and Egglant were not big but then some like the Water Boil chicken was rather big. 3. The food is spicy but it isn't hot. If I had to compare it to a Thai restaurant, the food is about a 5 on a 10 scale. You will probably need to ask them to make it spicier even if you are not one of those crazy people that have to eat everything hot. 4. They do NOT use reheated rice. I was expecting reheated rice that you typically find at Wongs and other Chinese restaurants. This place had fresh soft and sticky rice. It was great. 5. Don't take the American menu for granted. It's done pretty well and includes mainstream meats like chicken, beef, pork. The Chinese menu has tripe and meats not typically eaten by Americans which is why it's left off the American menu. You will likely use the American menu as your base and then use the Chinese menu to add select items. Bottomline: get both menus 6. The restaurant is not a hole in the wall. It's the opposite. It's the nicest Chinese restaurant I've been to in the valley. Yes it is small but stylish and well lit 7. The restaurant is definitely busy but not stand in line busy. We were immediately seated and we went on a Friday night at peak hour. 8. The service was suprisingly good. Like most great and authentic Chinese restaurants, the service is lousy with the waiters being expressionless and forcing you to order quickly. The servers were Chinese but were very friendly and acted like family. They didn't rush you. Water was refilled quickly 9. Dishes - read what has already been written. This is covered well. I insist on order the the Water Boil dish (includes choice of chicken, beef, fish or shrimp) and ordering it spicy! 10. You don't have to be with a big group, a grad student at ASU or someone who speaks Chinese to enjoy this restaurant. The idea intimidates people because they make it sound as if it's so authentic since it's included in the Chinese Cultural Center but don't be. My wife and I are not Chinese and it was just the two of us. And we had a great time
iB0Yif8tLUn2uvcwZWs67g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I forgot to mention....ask for the leather menus! those are the real ones and have English translation as well. I was eating there 3 days after the first one...so imagine how I liked the food there :)
DuEg9rMyWfu6SrlPitWjxw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I don't know how we even came across this complex. Luck I guess. Did anybody say it yet? well I'm not gonna look through all of the reviews and I'm too lazy to CTRL+F. But the water boiled beef is the SHIT! I couldn't decide between the chicken or beef, so the waitress let me do a combo. SWEEET. Chinese broccoli, dan dan noodles, too many goodies to name! Loav dees pless
dVYxZB4VQTtWZBvAfPnt9w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Make sure to get their secret Asian-only menu! Their food is pretty damn amazing. Their service sucks, but, honestly, if you can avoid taking it personally and being butt-hurt, it's completely worth it.
0x5QF7-kYFCbu6SKiBtt_w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Awesome food!!! The best Szechwan food in Phoenix!! Great location in China town and next to the chinese supermarket. Great for groups as well!
of0wwzxWecgF9DSSTqsf5Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This is by far the most authentic Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. The only problem is you have to know what to order. Which basically means go with someone that can read off the Chinese menu. If you're coming here for fried rice and crab puffs, you won't be impressed.
i0-5KzDis4IVj2XHU-xjCw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I would have to say that Szechwan Palace in the Chinese Cultural Center has to be the best Chinese Food that I've had in Phoenix & I've eaten at a lot of different Chinese restaurants over the years... All of the entrees were very flavorful, & came out of the kitchen piping hot in a timely manor, The servers were helpful , pleasant, & very polite. Now for the most attractive part of this dining experience... The amount of delicious food the my friend Michael & I got for just under $30 (The House Combo for 2) was astonishing. For that price we got hot green tea to keep us warm, 6 pot stickers, 2 spring rolls, 2 full entrees, a big bowl of sizzling rice soup a huge plate of house fried rice with chicken shrimp & pork in it, & to top it all off a bowl full of sweet lychee fruits for desert. Lets just say I will be frequenting the establishment in the near future. For all you out there on yelp or Facebook in the Phoenix area that wanna try this restaurant out it is located in the Chinese Cultural Center on 44th St. & Cofco Dr. just south of the loop 202.
66U6jT9KnNbNWNxDI0E_Ig	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	First I would like to say to everyone that complains about the service is to please stop bitching about it. Yea most of you are stuck in American ways and things should be set in a certain way everywhere. This is a AUTHENTIC Chinese food restaurant, it's not they are being rude or don't want to come back every 2 mins to make sure you are ok it's because there is literally 2-3 waitress's working at a time. I've been here probably 50-60 times since its my fiancé favorite Chinese place in phx, and shes from china and hates Americanized Chinese food, but every time I've been here when it's slow or packed I only see 2-3 waitress's and sometimes a helper here and there. So just be patient. The food is worth the wait if you order correctly. I've had a few americanized dishes and they were ok and my fiancé was like you need to order for, the authentic menu and wow I was surprised how Chinese food was suppose to taste like. Alot of the dishes have this weird tingly numbing feeling which is weird at first but you get used to it. A few things I can remember you should get that we always order, I don't know the Chinese names but I'll try to explain the best I can. 1. Husband and wife dish. It's a app and seved cold. About 7 bucks 2. Boiled fish in spicy sauce. 3. Spicy chicken wings but these are cut in half deep fried then cooked in peppers and spices. My favorite 4. Cucumber dish served cold and has tingly stuff on it. Like 4-5 bucks 5. Pork intestines cooked like the chicken wings above. I know that sounds gross but they taste really good. 6. Beef chow fun, yea this is a americanized dish but it's the best beef chow fun I've had anywhere. There is a few more but I'm drawing a blank. Anyways this is authentic Sichuan food so explore different dishes because they are GOOD!
FCNuGOMkefCA2ZmMBeXK_A	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I was in Phoenix for work and convinced my local colleagues to come to this restaurant. In summary, for Sichuanese food, this place is top notch. We have a handful of good Sichuanese places in the San Francsico area, and this place would fit right in. One tip: Order from the "Chinese menu". If you're looking at the menu that has "Mongolian Beef" or Egg Foo Yung, that's the wrong menu. I can only comment on the dishes I ordered from the one outing, but they all shined: -Water Boiled Fish (Shui Zhu Yu). There are different versions with beef, pork, or lamb, but the cooking preparation is the same. Spicy with red chili peppers and a healthy dose of Sichuan peppercorns which give a pleasant numbing/tingling sensation to the spice. -Cumin Lamb: Healthy dose of cumin. Good rendition. -Chongqing Spicy Chicken (Chongqing lazi ji): Ask for "with bones". The meat comes from the chicken wing and drumette portion. Comes covered with red chili peppers, but push those aside and just chowdown on the chicken wings and spit out the bones. -Green beans (gan bian si ji dou). A good rendition with some pungent garlic. big thumbs up and I'll stop by here again when I'm in the area for work.
fIrBGPqJsClTpOA2Ft5Rhg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	The lunch was priced right, the portion were generous and all was cooked just right. I had the shrimp and scallops = $8.00 covered all plus soup and egg role... I iwll be back!
SnIPTH0zMZv2YcVS6vpQTw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	After telling our friends about how awesome the Asian market was, they wanted to check out some of the restaurants. Every restaurant I've been to near an Asian market is fantastic and this is no exception. When we entered the place was packed which is always nice to see. The menu was huge which normally I don't like but this place has a great reason behind it - they offer traditional Chinese and Americanized dishes as well and they separate it on the menu too. We leaned more towards the American side since it was our first time. The pork fried rice was killer -the tables favorite. The chow mein was next in line and we got just the veggie version. We had some steamed buns that were probably closer to dumplings than buns, but of course those were fantastic as well. We had some chicken dishes too that were awesome but I can't remember what we had (which is probably a good thing so I make sure I get some of the traditional dishes next time). Because I am not as familiar with some of the dishes, I asked a lot of questions of both the servers and the people surrounding us. I mean how else are you supposed to find out whats good if you don't ask and the right people to ask are the Chinese (I hope that doesn't come off as offensive because I do not mean it that way at all!). For four people the meal was extremely reasonable and we got a free egg roll with our check in offer. Next time I go, I am going to ask more questions and pretty much have someone order me something delicious and traditional so I can try new things and learn more about the food and culture. Can't wait to go back.
ybxtjND1yq07PaxsSmPWHQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I try to go to this place once a week. I have limited time for lunch. Staff seats me right away and usually within 8 minutes of walking into the restaurant the food is at my table. The lunch menu is not expensive and you get a lot of food for your money. The staff is very friendly, quality food, great service, clean restaurant, great value. I wish all restaurants operated this way!!
4eXta4ufKZxdrMIesq5IQg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Amazing food. And they can make it spicy. Was recommended to me by my chinese labmate. According to him, this is the closest to authentic as it gets in Phoenix. The service is super fast. Not a lot of wait after you order. The waiters are more attentive to Chinese patrons i realized. (I have been here 50 times till date). My fav: beaf tendons, jalapeno chicken, water boiled fish. sesame rice filling balls(forgot what they are called). A note on takeout: Their online system is great. But they close at 3pm. If you placed your order close to 3, they have utter confusion on what to do. Call and confirm with them. Also, they have this stupid policy of giving one tiny takeout box of rice even if you ordered 10 dishes. Please keep that in mind and order rice.
4VCdIEfcfIg8xhksVz7fSg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	The closest thing you'll find to a Chinatown in these neck of the woods. The Shanghai style semi spicy fish filet and pork rice cake dishes reccomended by the peppy server/owner dude was delish! Shao lung bow was average at best.
h5zfoBhY3jm_bnZeSFpqZw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Been here alot love the food.Cummin beef and water boiled beef and jalapeño beef are my favorite the waiters don't know a lot of english my seem rude at time but I'm sure it's a language thing I remember one time I ordered and the waiter was no help had to ask for everything but I didn't mind because the food is worth it and when I was leaving I did not leave a TIP because I feel she didn't deserve it and the lady at the register saw I didn't leave a tip on my receipt and she goes to the table to see if I left a tip haha and she looks at me and says no TIP? Haha I was shocked I looked her right in the eye and said Yes No Tip!!! haha she got mad and talked to the other Chinese lady in chineses probley talking shit haha but the food is worth it
coCrtvC9su_f0-0JSSLfbA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	My wife and I love, love, love this place! Since discovering it a couple of months ago it has become a weekly treat. The dumplings in chili oil, vegetable fried rice and hot and sour soup are our regular items, usually supplemented by one other dish. The food is consistently great. Service is very fast and efficient, but they don't dote on you like some fine dining places. Highly recommended!
Oo6cTNVlG_apr2H2FwpIaw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Okay, people. There are NOT a lot of good Chinese restaurants in the state of Arizona. I know this because I have tried almost all of them in search of finding something equivalent to the restaurants in California. Szechwan Palace is the best place I have eaten at in this entire state so hooray for them!! I LOVE LOVE their pickled cabbage. It is ridiculous spicy and that just makes me extremely happy. You MUST get their Chinese menu (I think they have a different Chinese and American menu for people who are not used to eating traditional Chinese food). Their spicy cumin lamb is soo good. Actually, I've gotten a lot of dishes there and haven't really been disappointed by anything during dinnertime. Warning - during lunch, I think their lunch specials are only American-Chinese food which consists of orange chicken and broccoli beef which really does not represent how good the food is. Go for dinner and experience the real Chinese food :)
2nRNRCbCGScwUz__u0vcdQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I ordered the general tsao's chicken. No finer has passed through these lips. Seriously.
3OT4cnLmC3s2CBdCoyhL-g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	best szechwan cuisine in this town. spicy and delicious.
bBrdJr3zFPx0MRQwHwd8OA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Amazing sichuan place...I used to be a regular when I was in Phoenix. They used to make the best Kung Pao Tofu... But this time, I wanted to go with my current favorite sichuan dish.. dan dan noodles. They were amazing but I shouldn't have ordered them for lunch... they were no way enough for me. As always, the service was fast and the food was tasty. Really miss this place.
PE12HmGlDoQOddClbTTHMQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I've eaten here twice in the last few weeks and both times were with friends from mainland China - Shanghai and Beijing. Both of these friends proclaim the restaurant as very authentic and I agree, having visited China at least a dozen times. The food is tasty - I've eaten boiled chicken, kung pao chicken, pork noodle soup, pork dumplings, vinegar cucumber and sauteed garlic green beans. All delicious although I have a feeling I was eating a lot of calories. So if you desire authentic Chinese food such as you would get in Shanghai or Beijing, try this place. It's in the Chinese Cultural Center.
diWSf0id-2GgLBBBF-IQbA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	After not coming here for a whole my family decided to give it another try, and we were definitely surprised! The dan dan noodles as usual were fantastic, and what I said earlier about portion sizes getting smaller was totally wrong when they brought out the chicken! Service, which had been lacking before was fantastic. Overall, I would definitely recommend as far as Szechuan places go around here
anmew2y5UIzQOaEdmPsGoA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	My favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Very nice foods and very quick cooking. Nice environment (inside and outside), and nice service. I would recommend this place to any friends visiting Phoenix.
SI7KmiwwyuGSFzPBcQKWHQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I've been travelling to Phoenix for the past 5 years. Szechwan Palace is always on my list of restaurants to hit up during my stay. I have often been the only Caucasian customer in the restaurant during a visit. To me, this is a mark of a good Chinese joint. This is not your run of the mill average Americanized Chinese food. You can order from the American-Chinese menu or from the more authentic Chinese menu. I've had items from both and all were great. My favorite combination is the General Tso's (best I've ever had) and the steamed spicy pork dumplings. Go there. If you have a couple of extra minutes, drop in Super L Ranch Market, too. They have some interesting items.
r7HeXM17c-5aBjsO2FUJyg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	there food is aalways fresh i have been comming here since i can remember they have just gotten new managers and everything seems awesome the price range is awesome thier redoing the inside great thieft protection the best food better than pei wei
_kISFAtGr8eSIJ_ICVWZFw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	What can I say about China Chili that hasn't already been said in glowing write-ups in local magazines and the Arizona Republic? Probably not much. But, because you adore me, I'm going to throw in my opinion anyway. You're welcome. I first encountered China Chili while it was still operating at it's doomed Central Avenue location. Of course it wasn't doomed due to bad food, lousy service or any other detriment other than the light rail project's existence. So, it moved. After about 9 months it's back and ready to serve some of the best Chinese food in town. I've yet to venture to the part of the menu that offers duck, but I've tried several beef, chicken and pork dishes and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. My current favorite is the orange beef. Slightly sweet and a bit spicy, it's cooked golden and crispy and makes my tongue extremely happy. The dining room is wide open. No booths. All tables. The volume can get a little loud when there are many patrons, and there usually... there are many patrons. One thing that sets them apart from other Chinese places I've tried is the way that some of the chicken dishes are prepared. Typically, little bites of chicken are battered, fried and covered in sauce. At China Chili, the entire cut of chicken is battered, THEN sliced and covered in sauce. This makes it visually more appealing and you aren't consuming so much batter and grease. I'll be back many times in the future so I can get my Chili on.
3ANxVB_m599i1sc8wORnlg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I give China Chili 5 stars because it has some treats I can't find anywhere else. I've had quite a few things on their menu and I've only disliked one thing. My favorites include the steamed won-tons (very speesy spicy and sweet at the same time, so my man and I will literally battle if they give us an odd number. It gets bloody.), chicken corn chowder (introduced to me by the harbinger of good soups and even better taste, my dearly departed best friend Andre), mushroom and spinach soup (HUGE meaty mushroom chunks with tofu and spinach in a light chicken broth... it's light but flavorful), and my aforementioned sparring partner/boyfriend is crazy about the salt and pepper beef, which is a reasonable and edible facsimile of pepper spray when you get it made like he does. I can't even swallow the stuff, but he just powers it down like drano in a tub. We very rarely eat there because the decor is just so tacky, but we love it so much, we ordered out for it on our anniversary. Be that a testament to its deliciousness or our stubbornness is your decision.
FOhrjOD4riVzHnp1bpZSkA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	China Chili is my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Phoenix. They prepare their food the way you would at home without the typical mystery meat. The menu is full of lot's of choices. One of my favorites is the Honey Walnut Prawns. The Pillow Tofu is good even if you don't like Tofu. One of the Vegetable dishes (sides) that they are known for is their Spicy Garlic Eggplant. The servings are large though, so consider sharing and getting a couple of items. The Chicken Salad is a great summer lunch dish. It is great to go. The managers are some of the nicest people you will meet.
_0VR3Mxkj_VQ_MlclW_Xqg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	If you like Chinese Buffets, then this place is not for you. China Chili is probably the most authentic Chinese food I've had in AZ. Makes me feel like I'm in New York, or better yet, CHINA! I have a theory when it comes to Chinese food - if there are lots of Asian people there, its prbably good, because for them its food. Order the orange chicken, salty squid, eggplant in garlic sauce or the mayonaise shrimp and walnuts. All are out of this world! I even had my wedding rehearsal dinner, that's how much me and the family love this place! The staff are attentive, courteous and happy to answer any questions you have. It doesn't get much better than this!
tKIbThcwbb_7uMgkSMlFGQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	There is no way I could say a single bad thing about this place. Every time I have been here, it is the exact same thing. The service is quick and attentive, the food is fantastic and brought out freakishly fast, and the meal is always fairly cheap. Funny thing is, I used to be afraid of this place because of the name. The husband always wanted to try it, but I said it sounded creepy. As a side note, I am not a fan of spicy foods. I have since come to realize I really like Asian spicy, I do not like Mexican spicy. So I'm a food racist. Our first time here we ordered the orange chicken and the lemon chicken. The orange chicken was nice and crispy, with the chicken being super juicy. The orange sauce was amazing. It was subtly spicy at first, and then the heat just built up from there. We still order this every time. The lemon chicken is nice. A light sauce that doesn't overpower the chicken. Another good bet. Since then we have tried many other dishes, the Almond Cashew Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, and the Honey Walnut Prawns. Holy Crap! You have never tasted how good prawns can be until you eat the Honey Walnut Prawns. The lovely little crustaceans are served on a bed of shredded cabbage. They are smothered in a sweet and tangy mayo sauce (I know it sounds kind of gross, but trust me and try it). Then sprinkled all over the top are this wickedly good honey glazed walnuts. What an amazing dish. China Chili, I learned my lesson... Never judge a restaurant by it's name.
9TfIHAqQ_Sr7ytPPmphdYw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Chinese food is one of those things for me... once I find a place I love, I stick with it! That was the story for my last Chinese Restaurant until they abruptly closed one day without notice...yes I am bitter. The restaurant I am referring to was a little place called "Silver Dragon" south of Dunlap on 19th Ave. It was the Cheers of Chinese... I walked in and everybody knew me, and immediatley started to make my meal (they would double or triple it, if I had company). My favorite dish, was called Singapore Rice Noodle.... obviously a rice noodle dish that included stir fried spare ribs, chicken, shrimp, green and yellow onions tossed with a non-spicy curry sauce. When they closed, I was in a state of depression for nearly two years!! Until last night, when I happened upon China Chili, not my first visit, but my first SIT DOWN experience with the restuarant. I do what I have done at every chinese restaurant since Silver Dragon... I opened the menu and went directly to the noodle dishes to see if they offered "Singapore Rice Noodle". Much to the delight of my stomach, they did and it was EXACTLY the same as I remember it at Silver Dragon. I am already conspiring to have it again today for lunch!!!! Oh... they have the fastest service here too, not more than five minutes after we ordered appetizers were already coming out!
ZMtPwgJ3pUXfKaShHB06Nw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	My girlfriend first took me to China Chili a few years ago--she had gone to an arts school in Phoenix from Mesa and it was a staple for her--she craved China Chili. It only took me one visit to this restaurant to know that this is the real thing--the food was amazing, the waitress close-lipped, the prices perfect. The thing about China Chili is that it's pretty legit--if you order something bland you'll get a bland dish, if you order something boring you get that same turn of hand. The key to China Chili is taking the exotic route, ordering that item you wouldn't normally order, shooting at a risk. You'll be well-rewarded. Oh, and if you're really feeling frisky, you can ask for their Chinese menu, which features some of the more unusual items, fish bellies and the like. Still, I have a feeling you'll be delighted. Go for the gold at China Chili.
f8iA6n6bFDDfc30P9TupAQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Yes Go to China Chili! I was tipped off by a friend to this place...a little bit out of my "hood" but what the hey. For starters they are good about QUALITY, Yeah I said it QUALITY. We could make wonton soup and let it get mushy and bland. China Chili's is very fresh tasting...lots of mildly crunchy cabbage...YUM! My husbands new love affair with Singapore Noodles was once again renewed. He ate almost the entire (giant) portion. I was intrigued by Pillow Chicken (where do you find this at other places?...you don't!). Chicken and water chestnuts wrapped in a light almost rice dough...with black pepper sauce. All the right combinations working together to make a great dish! Will we go back..YES! Now we just have to drive a bit further to great Chinese cuisine.
xOqcOZ9QA27Ezvphr_10tQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	If you're looking for a more traditional Chinese experience for your pallet while in a traditional American setting with actual silverware look no further. Always yummy, it's one of my favorite Chinese places.
PohoqqoLXEo186Qro0vRNA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	China Chili doesn't sound like much, and frankly it doesn't look like much either. But then when I opened the door from the 3rd Street side I was struck with the loud noise of a full house of hungry and happy eaters. So far I've only had the spicy Sichuan prawns, and it delivered. It was a hot, spicy and a wonderful blend of spices including garlic and chilies. Most of the items on the lunch menu were labeled 'spicy', and so hopefully the others are this good too. By the look of the other diners, the smiles seemed to indicate good stuff. The service was efficient and fast, too. Highly recommended.
Rv-jjUwI3sdPL0fq6diS-w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	The lunchtime service here is so fast they either use cooking ninjas or a microwave. No human can cook this fast. Maybe the servers read your mind? Consistent, hot and cheap. A Phoenix staple... Probably why I see Jerry Colangelo here all the time.
g55ByJNEVuvR2TvrXldgYA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Always great. Always friendly. The four musts: honey walnut prawns, pillow tofu, orange chicken and hot and sour soup. Four of us last night got to have them all- best meal in Phoenix.
90saTUSdssj30-6GO7Oixw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	So yummy & so fast! House special chicken & orange chicken are my favorites. Plus they use all white chicken breasts. I love that "spicy" dishes can be ordered a little more mild; satisfies the entire lunch group dining together.
0OpZ71ktE7CTSi7wgEXbNg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Best Chinese food in Phoenix. I've been going to China Chili since it's original location on Central and Osborn and followed it like many of its fans to its much larger location which accommodates all of its patrons. I don't usually bother writing reviews for places that have over 50 reviews but after reading some of the reviews, I want to set things straight. First of all, I've been to the Chinese Cultural Center and am not a fan whatsoever. China Chili blows the Cultural Center out of the water. The beauty of China Chili (and only you regulars know this), they will make everything made-to-order. In other words, if you want white meat only, with just light sauce and medium spice, they will do it just like that and deliver it steaming hot to your table within 5 minutes. The wait staff, if you get to know them, are extremely nice, kind and so sweet. They may not be too chatty but don't take it personal. So next time, if you want your Chinese food in a certain way, just ask. They will give you exactly what you want.
N3_7Jw8av3sPZ1LaniyfIg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	awesome!!!
QGk1Nbb0Yvbggi8DKUDd3w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This place was delicious. It's what I think of when I remember the chinese food places my mom and dad used to talk us to growing up in the phoenix area. Recently it seems like most of the places are super run down, the service is mediocre, and the products used in the food are down right embarrassing, well China Chilli DELIVERS! Their food was great (Veggie Lo-Main, Spicy Garlic Prawns *i dont know if this is exact name*, and the Fried Tofu special with jalapenos which wasn't bad for somebody who doesnt like Tofu) and the service was above average. The tell tale sign of this place was two things before I ate the food, how clean it was inside (and kinda chinese cheesy) and the parking lot was full when I drove by and when I came back to eat in addition to that there was a constant flow of people ordering take out. If you are in the mood for chinese take-out or to pop in for a quick bite, I would definitely recommend this over any other place around Cen-Pho that I've come across.
QrnscrdxRmOTqHCGOVXgzA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Always good! ...Portions are big! ...Great spacious place, lots of tables. ...Always a reliable place for some good Chinese Food! ;P
xnF5IfjwAx8RB3-wYzqljw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I love this place! I've been here a few times now with co-workers, and everytime I come, I leave with leftovers and content with my experience. The service is great and fast (important for those on a time budget), the food is really good, I enjoy the Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao Chicken, and the prices are very affordable - $6 to $8 for the lunch special. It's definitely worth a try!
59Ptiyg5uppDz57VB3Vdpg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I would say this is the best Chinese food I've had so far in Phoenix area. Have eaten twice, though both times take out, when having dinner with friends who live close to the restaurant. The honey walnut prawns are really tasty, and my other favorite was their eggplant. So delicious! I wish they were not so far from where we live or I'd go back more often.
ZYNr3XW-5T2EzUSnLCu2Yw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Woohoo Chinese food! Found out about this place from neighbors. It's close enough to walk from my new condo. Great service. Once you step inside you get the feeling that you are in San Francisco for Chinese dining. We loved the walnut fried prawns and the chicken curry! This will be my new go-to place for Chinese food (dine in and take out). China Chili, I'm glad you're nearby.
5Vh8EtCE2RFBP9v8q4tprw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Great service and food was amazing. I got the Mongolian beef lunch special. The portion was enormous and I took half of it with me (cold Chinese food makes a great snack.) The Mongolian beef was perfectly spicy. The hot and sour soup was delicious as well... And they gave me a free refill on it too. My drink was never more than halfway empty and I felt like I was being treated like a king. I will definitely be going back.
yhhLGb9A08j4Cn9_1dU5LA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Great service, delicous food, wish I had found it sooner :)
S6NtxXeNSEgxxrywQx9vYQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Temporal cooking at its best! I can't remember how many times I've ordered and the food was out before the water was... you definitely get a LOT of food for the price, and everything I have tried has been awesome.
LKS2IpQDiJ48tXCCIBFEVQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Pretty good food. Shows up hot & fast and the service was some of the best I've had. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.
SoUiSFWXO71Zzzq4Z5eb3A	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	My husband grew up eating at this restaurant since he was young. From the staff to the food, there is nothing to complain about. We love so many different dishes here, but if we have to narrow it down to 3 it is... extra spicy orange chicken, salt and pepper calamari, and the Szechwan shrimp. The orange chicken is whole chicken breast that is breaded instead of little nuggets. You get more chicken than a ton of breading. The orange sauce is amazing, especially with some spice. The salt and pepper calamari.. may not seem all that exciting or exotic, but it is delicious! I love the favors the green onions and jalapeño with the salt and pepper. Our newest favorite dish is the Szechwan shrimp. It is different from what I had growing up. I don't like szechwan anything, so I would have never given this dish a second glance. Of course one day, my friend ordered it and I just about died! I know I am pretty optimistic with my reviews, but I mean it, this dish is delicious and weirdly refreshing. It has undertones of cilantro and it comes with cucumbers!
-QiqT0TrOnrzOZIZ7cWepA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Excellent service, you are always greeted at the door and never have to ask to a refill. Great Chinese food in general, comes out quick for those in a hurry. Also, I am more willing to drive across town just for their boiled wonton spicy peanut soup - phenomenal
ABPp9kvvvJd2QNUv3lN6HQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	He a group of six, all we very happy. We all ordered different items and appetizers and had to bring home food. Portions are large and service was great.
7t-BzkhZ10KfOWevMg9IMw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I've been hunting for a place like this since I moved to Phoenix in 98'. My wife and I ate here for lunch a couple of weeks ago. Nothing fancy on the inside or outside but the service and the food are great. My wife and I shared a plate of the Orange Chicken and a plate of the Mongolian Beef. They were both great! Within a minute of ordering, we had the egg drop soup in front of us. It wasn't the best I've ever had, but above average. You can't get better service either. Looking forward to going back!
cPb0CdhH-pOvcSr9TwIyrw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Best orange chicken! They use strips of chicken breast with a thin batter. The orange sauce has a tang to it. All-time favorite! I get take-out so I really can't rate the service but they are fast.
wk3v-EyEPx1j3TsNp1p7vg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Food exceeded expectations. Waitress was quietly attentive. We are discerning Chinese diners and will definitely come back. Spicy Hunan Tofu very nice!
mRotyErpPcNCmnUEc8QpPQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I went here after seeing all the good reviews. It lives up to expetations. Kung pao chicken and mongolian beef were delicious. The staff was out quick and served quick. I'll certainly be back.
EyimZjdJU4ibFgNZXLaszw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Good authentic Chinese Food, just need to know what dishes to order and to ask for spicy or non spicy. Good Peking Duck, House Special Chow Mein and Tofu with Cha Sui. Very busy during lunch with downtown customers where they will seat you in a table to share with others. Service is always good and prompt with good prices. Pretty clean for a Chinese Restaurant, you will not be disappointed.
chQc-1eVt710ltXa8DrvCA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	A truly authentic Chinese restaurant.The Boiled won tons are outstanding.We also ordered the Singapore noodles ,equally as good.The lettuce leaves are wonderful. In fact almost every dish is worthy of praise. Service is good. The wine list is fairly priced . Also worth mentioning, it is a kid friendly Restaurant.
pkgBSFhKpazRLbpkQg2FsQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	We love this place! When compared to the other places in Phoenix, China Chili is at the top. My favorite is the Black Pepper Sizzling Beef. Pork Imperial Sauce is also a favorite. Service is good and friendly.
fFgyDuMYyJFEXrhkGbtHIQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This is one of my reviews that I struggled with writing, not because of the business...but because I didn't want anyone else to know. I must have put off this review for weeks as I enjoyed dish after dish of their delicious beef fried rice and spicy eggplant. The only thing that changed my mind and why I've decided to share this hidden gem is because they can handle the volume. Even on a Friday night where they had over 100 people in their sitting area, I called for a take out order and they said 15 minutes! Every other time I call it is usually 10 minutes, but to be totally slammed and only have the wait go up 5 minutes is amazing. So here are the dishes as I love em: - Beef fried rice, no peas, no carrots. I swear I could eat a whole order by myself, but my thighs would hate me in the morning. - Spicy eggplant...perfect mixture of tangy and spicy. Fell in love the first time I got it. - Honey walnut shrimp. Very good. I've tried various other dishes, had family over from Hong Kong and everyone can vouch for the authenticity of the taste. Do not hesitate about this place. The other reason I've decided to review this place is because I never want it to go out of business, I want to enjoy for years to come.
Nja6Rt47XH25IHskbzvZMQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Love love love China Chili. We've been searching for a good Chinese food place for years ever since our old standby closed down and we've finally located a winner! My favorite is the Mongolian chicken, crab puffs, and fried rice. The service is prompt and the place is huge and comfortable. One of our new favorites!
OD4xoE9dzbn2hROY8CP_MA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I love this place! Wish my work was still close to it because I'd eat there at least once a week for lunch. Their lunch specials are so inexpensive! We're talking $5-$6 a plate which includes the entree, rice and a cup of soup. Can't get better than that. Their service during lunch is amazingly fast. That way if you only have an hour for lunch, you're in and out with time to spare. My most recent review is when 14 of my friends and I went to China Chili for dinner. We actually planned on going to Gallo Blanco but it was almost a 2 hour wait to accommodate our party. So off to China Chili we went and there was no wait to boot! We ordered the peking duck, mongolian beef, house chow mein, fried rice, walnut shrimp, peking pork chops, crispy noodles, ma po tofu...and really, that's all I can remember. Some of the guys also had beers and sake. I can't think of one dish that I did not like. This place does NOT disappoint. After stuffing our faces, we were delighted that our bill, plus tax and gratuity ended up being $10 a person. What a deal!!! I am a huge fan of China Chili!
_9_Jv7qihUosTkaVVzAC6w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	You want great chinese food with good prices and service this place is the real deal!! Came here last night everything was on point from the food to service to prices would definetly recommend
DaAfOEgTrRdlcOQde8k_tw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Great Chinese Food! Real Chicken served fresh unlike the double fried chicken you get at most places. Highly recommend.
iTEQko8DeNv1O4dK8gtyow	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Absolutely love this place! Try the orange chicken and the chicken corn chowder soup... It's amazing!
LVI7ZLBZf5paXI8ARc_-YA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This was one of the best Chinese Restaurant experiences I've ever had...everything was delicious...there were dishes there I've never seen offered before. This was my first time there but will definitely eat here again when in Phoenix!
hbpD5j1ipqqgDrJt5YBKiQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This is my go to spot for Chinese food. It's always fresh and yummy. I typically get the orange chicken with rice. The chicken is white breast meat and not prepared the typical deep fried way. Also their soups are good. Everything is always great and super fast takeout!
K0bMhldoyz-v6w74GM0KmQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I've been coming here for years and it's always a must stop when I'm visiting family in Arizona. The House Special Chicken is one of my all time favorite dishes and it always tastes the same. No corners being cut at this place. I love China Chili. Seriously, I LOVE China Chili!
1uJ-ZvJHUoxoED6-De8L5Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	The lunch menu is all 7.95. The Kung pao dishes are all great. service is top level. Awesome and consistent food top to bottom on the menu. I come here every year with my wife from Alaska. This is one of our mandatory stops while in Phoenix.
QKarIslmhAmmplepGGl-HQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	My favorite is the orange chicken! It's quick & inexpensive... with a far higher quality then you might expect judging from the price!
mZBt99BKuvMydrg57nHtSA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Best egg roles.
JYULw_PiDMbgf4z4KX6BOA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Fresh, fast, reasonably priced, and flavorful! No complaints and would recommend to anyone!
QoVxI9kU6B1SLNfiMuMjJA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Best Chinese in Phoenix hands down. The hot and spicy prawns are a must and so are the house chow fun noodles.
mKCR_mC5GtNTdxDsty8Mzg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	We tried China Chili for the first time this past Monday with my family, after hearing about it from friends and family for a long time. The place did not disappoint. It is clean, spacious, and nicer than some of the other Chinese food dives that we love to frequent. The service was fast and attentive. We ordered the following: West Lake soup, honey walnut prawns, beef chow fun (dry), sesame chicken, mongolian beef, house fried rice, garlic green beans with tofu and Peking pork chop. Our favorite restaurant is Hong Kong Dining on 24th St and Indian School, but China Chili has some dishes that surpass them. The West Lake soup was good, not too thick with good flavor. I thought the garlic green beans were top notch, as were the honey walnut prawns. Those three dishes I would come back for any day. The sesame chicken was ok -- it was sliced chicken with sesame sauce poured over it. I prefer the more Americanized version where individual pieces of chicken are deep fried in a sesame sauce. I would say the same of the Peking pork chop -- I prefer the dish made by Hong Kong Dining. CC's seemed to have too much sauce that was maybe a little too sweet. All in all a gem of a Chinese restaurant that we will definitely frequent when we are on that side of town!
SEo27gJ1JB2EZGw3psnJfA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Hobby_Shops Comic_Books Shopping Books,_Mags,_Music_&_Video 5_star	I would like to respond to Jetta's description below. I like AABC for all the reasons he doesn't like them. Yes, they may only sell comics and toys but they do that better than anyone else. It's about quality not quantity. He asked how they stay in business when there are so many comic stores in the valley. The truth is the other stores are garbage. Read on (1) They don't pilfer through the comics before putting them on the shelves. The owner even unloads the comics from the boxes right in front of you and lays them out on a glass table. So if you are guy who is trying to acquire that CGI 10.0, you will have a chance at this store. At Atomic Comics and the other stores, they go through the comics before the store opens and selectively remove the comics in the very best condition for their employees. (2) They leave the comics on the shelves longer. They are not greedy. They don't pull a comic off a shelf and mark it up a $1-$2 a week to two weeks later. They only do this if a comic is ridiculously hot which is rare. It's nice to know that you can find a comic a month after it arrived on the market selling at cover price. There is not another comic store in Phoenix that does this. Take my word for it. I've been to everyone and they pull them off the shelves quickly (3) They don't stuff their shelves and the comics are in great condition. I have been to every comics store in the valley and AABC is the only store in which the comics are consistently in great conditions on the shelves. You will not see bent corners. You won't see shelves being overly stuffed so that the first few issues and the last few issues in a stack are damaged. (4) Inventory- If its not at AABC, I go to the internet because it's not going to be at any other store in the valley. I have too many stories of walking into other comic stores and requesting an issue and they are out or don't have it only to find 2 or 3 copies at AABC. (5) Sales: there is not another store in the valley that gives you 25% of everything in the store on Jan 1st and July 4th every year. That includes the high priced collectors items like Incredible Hulk 181. They also have a graphic novel punch card much like a Subways sandwhich card. (6) Service: It has a mom and pop feel so you get to know the actual owners of the store. The employees actually work and are helpful if you ask questions. They are not just standing around chatting with each other like you find at Atomic Comics. They are also humble and are not condescending. This is a great place for collectors and readers of all experience. They are also not pushy. They don't push any comics on people. I love how you can stare at comics for 45 min in peace without someone hassling you or making you feel guilty. They will help if you need it but they will leave you alone. (7) Ambience: I feel like I'm walking into a Comic store not a Nine Inch Nails museum. It's colorful, clean, organized and easy to navigate. it doesn't look like some cheap strip mall store like Heroes or god forbid Stalking Moon in which it seems like some Geek bough a collection on Ebay and decided to pay rent next to some Chinese buffet and open a comics store. (8) JUST COMICS: This is exactly why I come here. I was at Atomic Comics in Chandler and I couldn't even check out some comics because the shelf was being blocked by a card table. (9) Clientele: Look, I'm not a typical comic collectors. I don't wear tight black shirts, I have no facial hair or piercings, I'm not up to date on all the independent "alternative" comics, I love Marvel and DC. I can't stand "Goth." Yeah, I'm a regular guy who also happens to like comics. If you are one of these people, you will feel comfortable here. If you haven't read comics in ages and just wanna check out the scene, this is your place (10) KNOWLEDGE: The employees are educated about comics but are not pretentious. Phil is a comics' genius but he isn't intimidating. Eddie is very up-to-date on all the latest indie stuff but he will tell you honestly what he thinks about an issue and if a series is worth collecting. No pushy sales people To show that I'm not the owner and to be fair, I do think their prices can be steep and I don't always think their older items are accurately described. I also think they can charge too much for variant issues when they first arrive. Their toy prices are pretty fair and you can get steals in this
V_fugKf7dVcrU7Ag3ouTQQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	You know how everyone has that go-to place to take visiting friends and other out-of-town guests...this is mine. I've taken my sister and her boyfriend, my cousin and her boyfriend, several other couples, and they've always LOVED this restaurant. Located in an unassuming little stripmall on Camelback (because creative contemporary architecture no longer exists in Arizona), the Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe is so tucked away, you'd never know it existed. Even if you did, you'd never know it was so damn good. Any how, a friend introduced me, and I am in love with this place for the following reasons: 1. QUALITY. The food is ALWAYS excellent. I've never had anything bad here and it's always fresh and tasty. 2. VARIETY. My boyfriend and I love this place because he can get REAL Chinese and I don't have to eat forture cookies and water. The theme is noodles, so we encompass all Asian varieties and Italian as well. They also have other Asian options such as a Japanese bento-box, sushi, edemame, etc. It's weird that they come to your table with bread and they latter on you're eating tempura...but that's the appeal. Great desserts too! 3. AMBIANCE. I always describe it as Tokyo Disneyland. It's like a Japanese take on European provincial. There's a nice brick facade inside, nice fixtures, big, solid-hunk-of wood rustic tables, filagree metal light fixtures, etc. It's just pleasant and romantic. 4. STAFF They've got that perky-Japanese thing down, even the non-Asian wait staff. They're always smiling and helpful. The girls are cute and perky. They're always just really nice people. So, come to the Cherry Blossom. You can bring out-of-town friends and maybe convince them that that Valley isn't all Mexican or big-box/chain places. BTW, since the place is small and intimate, small double-dating size groups are good, but this is no place for massive groups.
amnYIjNw7QIILbppwFgApw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	The tempura orange roughy has ruined me on all other food. It was possibly the most delicious thing I have ever had. The coating was crunchy, but not rough and the sauce it came in was rich and delicious! My husband is constantly dragging me to Chinese places that serve mediocre noddle dishes with so much salt, I can barely finish them, but this was a pleasant surprise! The atmosphere was lovely and the green tea ice cream was amazing! Cannot wait to go back. Oh yeah, it's incredibly reasonable for the food your getting. We couldn't believe how little we paid for such fantastic food!
jPW2dGZnzxTVh3Y_6xoIAg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	One of my all-time favorite places. What other Asian restaurants serves you bread (super yummy bread I might add) at the beginning of the meal? The menu features Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and Italian.... yes that's right, Italian dishes. I've never had any of the Italian items but friends of mine say they're delicious. I honestly have never had a bad meal or bad service there. Lots of tofu and veg-head selections, plus fabulous sushi, noodle bowls and rice dishes. The lunch time Bento box specials are a must--tons of food, great price.
EnrLzpf2ew4XCRul5GKSbQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Cant believe its a 2.5 average. I work around central and Indian School and this is THE Chinese buffet for everyone here. Plenty of selection and its always good. The servers are polite and its cheap. Think its around 7 bucks. They recently renovated and its much nicer inside. I have been there a ton of times and never been unsatisfied. If someone has a Chinese buffet that beats it out on price and quality in this area please do tell!
Ek7FQA0MOzA6biI29CKENA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I've been going here steadily for the last 10 years and it's by far the best chinese buffet in the valley. They've got tons of fresh sushi and any kind of food you want. The spicy chicken and sweet shrimp are my favorites. The place has been completely overhauled as of the last months and it's never looked better. The owners are always on site, and if you want a specific kind of roll/sashimi/nigiri they're very happy to accomodate you.
FTgAbptYvfQ2cx4Utnm_wQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Growing up in Phoenix, I have always eyed Long Wong's while in the family car. "Is it Chinese food?" No. My friend had taken me there yesterday for lunch. She had claimed these are the best wings ever and I was a bit skeptical. I mean, what can be better than Buffalo Wild Wings? I had ordered the Honey-Hot and my friend got Medium. Upon first bite, it was pure bliss! The wings were deep-fried perfectly and the sauce had me burning up with a sweet after-taste. This is by far the best place for wings! If only they'd kick out annoying high school brats... XD!
u_pu6nD2L9Muje-ItgrP4g	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Growing up in Phoenix this was THE place to go to get wings! Before their redecorating back in 09' it was very "cozy" and very "loud" (I'm saddened to see it "toned down" after the redecoration) on the outside. This is THE place to go for a great deal on wings. 12 for $5? 50 for $24? Hell yeah man! They deep-fry them perfectly - they're still juicy in the middle; the mild, medium, hot, suicide, teriyaki, bbq, honey hot, is really delicious. My family and I love mixing up the teriyaki and medium sauce to give it a great sweet/hot/tangy flavor. When I moved to Tempe, I missed the place; and the other ones - Mill (even though they closed, I still tried them)? Scottsdale? Mesa? Uh, no. Nowhere NEAR as fantastic as compared to the first and original Long Wongs in Phoenix, AZ. I've even ate at the Long Wongs Bars and Grills - the prices were too much for me, 6 for $5? No thanks. I love it as they also take your food to your seats, but always remember to clean up after yourselves! The trash can is the huge Hippo statue by the door ;) The staff and owners are really awesome and sweet, I love playing Pinball and the old retro 80's arcade games while waiting for my food. The second best Long Wongs I would have to give props to is the one on Indian School Rd - we found this other gem while the original Long Wongs was still remodeling (and they had given a list of other locations).
Xskd0SigaDiHoRxYjw8hyw	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 5_star	No, the "quaint" building on Thomas doesn't look like a 5 star restaurant, but they've got the best wings I've found in Phoenix. By far. Oregano's, Buffalo Wild Wings, none of them compare with the greasy, spicy, juicy perfection of Long Wong's wings. And they've got great prices. My family of 4 will frequently order the bucket of 72 wings, for only $32.52. For those of you who are curious, that's only 45 cents a wing! Every day of the week! We love the Hot and Honey Hot in particular, but all are delicious. Although, the BBQ and Garlic Parmesan are a little too sauce-y for me. Some others have criticized the service; I've never had a problem. That being said, they do seem to have a limited staff. Every time I've gone the same man and woman have been managing the restaurant. It does get crowded around dinner time and there isn't really a clear system of lines for those who are picking up and those who are ordering. Also, when they're busy you may not be able to call ahead. Superbowl Sunday the phones were constantly busy so I ended up having to go in and order there, then wait. But overall I've found the service to be just fine and the staff to be pleasant. Not a place for a romantic dinner, but if you wanna see how comfortable you really are with your SO, take them here and watch each other stuff your faces with wing-goodness. Yum
8lIiAsnoI7d6rwPZU-Gp0Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 5_star	The original. The best. The undisputed CHAMP of burgers, wings and all things in between in Phoenix. Ron has been serving it up for 30 years. He's from Buffalo - he knows wings. Everything else - the burgers, the dogs, and even the Indian Fry Bread - are fantastic. Have only $5 for lunch? Ron's got you covered with the Fat Ass Special. PERFECT to watch football and basketball games in. Great local family crowd. Do NOT settle for imitations - make the trip to the ORIGINAL Long Wong's at 28th St. & Thomas!
XyIqR5Fa5Tx44p8Cx4j84Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 5_star	The best hot wings in the Valley. Hell, in the World. I love their hot wings. I recently spent 5 months on bed rest in Good Sam Hospital (a very rough pregnancy) and my husband would have to go get me Long Wong's Hot Wings just to satisfy my intense craving for them. What I like best about them is that they are well cooked so they aren't fatty, with big fat deposits in the chicken skin itself. Nothing is grosser to me than biting into a chicken wing and getting a big mouthful of greasy, fatty flabby chicken skin. YUCK. Long Wong's wings are deep fried and come out meaty and chewy and little bit crispy. Delicious! Kinda like the perfectly browned skin on the Thanksgiving turkey, but covered in delicious hot wing sauce. Someone once complained that they were similar to chicken jerky and I think that was a compliment! The way they are cooked you can appreciate the meat and crispy skin and the sauce and you don't have to muck through a heavy breading or flabby, fatty chicken skin. Their $5 cheese pizza isn't bad either. And for some odd reason their fountain Pepsi is somehow more yummy than most fountain dispensed Pepsi at other restaurants. I don't know if they can adjust the mixture and in this case they are running a stronger Pepsi mixture? All I know is it's better than most places. Good cheap food. I like it.
N6dqbvnsKJMdDv_OV1DcAQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 5_star	We went there because of the ridiculous stuff that they had outside their building, and the inside was no different. But it was fun to go to. It's known for their hot wings, but the burgers that we ordered were amazing! Also the wings were drenched in sauce and tasted really good as well. It was a fun place to eat at, definitely recommend it for the wings and burgers.
IyHSWJR5e23K4eRwjh9gqQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 5_star	My first time eating here, I gave chance to try the Wings - BBQ. And I loved it. Finish the Wings with a messy face, and licking my figures off from the BBQ. Definitely would come back if I'm near long Wongs.
ktkykIohkU8mu1RCKPF-eQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I am happy to report that after some quality hitches that I mentioned in my last review, Long Wong's is back to good!! I've been in several times since my last review and each time the pizza and Pepsi were perfect and the wings were amazeballs. Seems they took note of the issues and corrected them, good on them! If you haven't had Long Wongs wings then you really should try them. In my humble opinion they beat all the other wing places, hands down.
PrjZNZ_TRiUfuIyrMx6uRA	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 5_star	five stars for a joint like this? yeah. you have to know what you are getting into, as it wont be everyones cup of tea though. but if you want cheap sandwiches, hot wings, fresh baked deserts and PINBALL this is a great find
iD2rxQFphQ8BRnYInSsFFQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Shopping Home_Decor Food Beer,_Wine_&_Spirits Home_&_Garden Furniture_Stores 5_star	I love Cost Plus! If you are sick of decorating your house with Linens and Things than you need to come here. Cost Plus World Market is pretty self explanatory in the title. Basically they sell imported furniture housewares, groceries, wine, and anything you would use to decorate. I have a lot of weird little trinkets in my room from this place such as: A Chinese painting kit Elephant wall hanging magnetic board Buddha painting They also have an awesome coffee and tea area where I found the Chai tea mix I love as well as coffee syrups I used when I was a barista. Why not add some global influences to your decorating style?
0PZ3S933ug1qJ8h1GBFt9Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Pizza American_(New) Restaurants 5_star	I was actually surprised with how good the service and Chinese chicken salad was at lunch. Far better than the CPKs back home in SoCal. Way to go Phx AZ !
qQzLRqRMLz_vlL-QzxUgEg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 5_star	this is truly a mom and pop chinese restaurant (the mom is the waitress/bus girl/hostess and the pop is the cook) a ton of the local chinese folks eat here and i thought it would be my duty to let the rest of the world in on a well kept secret. if i've eaten here 20 times, i've seen someone from the chinese community here 15 times. some of the best chinese restaurants gain there claim to fame from word of mouth and sadly not on yelp the food is authentic "toi-son" style southern hillbilly food. same stuff my grandma would make: 1) foo-guah guy (bitter melon w/chicken) 2) lin-ngah gong (lilly root soup) 3) hom-yee guy-lup chow-fon (salty fish with chicken fried rice) 4) muy-toy kow-yoke (fatty pork with preserved vegetables) if it's your 1st time trying out the place try from the above list or: 1) beef chow fun 2) peking pork chops 3) green beans with preserved vegetables 4) steam chicken with ginger/garlic sauce 5) fried chicken wings 6) filet fish with chinese broccoli 7) walnut shrimp 8) tomato beef chow mein with pan fried noodles caveat: the decor is cheezy, the bathrooms are sleazy, but the prices are easy again, get over the decor and eat some of the best home-style chinese cooking :)
IvF7FUDaATDeznl0PnOITg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 5_star	To start off, this place is actually called "New Hong Kong" restaurant. http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-hong-kong-phoenix It was originally called Hong Kong Restaurant from the 1950's and they kept the 60 year old sign in the parking lot (kinda nostalgic). If you look at the sign on the building, it says New Hong Kong (kind of confusing when you Yelp it) If you ask any of the old school chinese who have lived in central phoenix for the past 50 years where to get authentic home style cooking, they know it's at NHK. If you ask the buffet community where to eat, this place is probably not on the top 100 (disclaimer: I've never eaten the lunch buffet) Sadly, it seems that the old school chinese community that patronize this place don't give it the Yelp reviews that it deserves, hence the low ratings. If you're looking for traditional Cantonese style food, here's a list of semi-authentic stuff I recommend: 1) Beef chow fun 2) Tomato beef over Hong Kong style noodles 3) Fish filet over Gai Lon (Chinese broccoli) 4) Salt/pepper chicken wings (not on the menu) 5) Peking pork chops 6) West lake beef soup 7) X.O. green beans If you want to go hard core Toi-sahn hillbilly style home cooking like poh-poh and ngain-ngain used to make: 1) Hom-yee guy lup chow fon (preserved salty fish, with chicken fried rice) 2) Foo-guah guy, Ow-see (Bitter melon chicken with black been sauce) 3) Gee-ngoke-beng (Steamed pork with preserved salty fish) 4) Hoh-yeow gai-lon (Steamed chinese brocolli with oyster sauce) 5) Bok-jom-guy (Boiled chicken with garlic and ginger sauce) 6) Muy-choi-kow-yuk (Fatty pork hot-pot with preserved vegetable) 7) Bok choy with black mushroom Occasionally, they will bring out the compimentary house special Doang-guah gong (winter melon) or linh-gnaw gong (some sort of chinese turnip) soup. This place is a well kept secret, spread the wealth I tell ya.
0QMqzeeT_6JvNJrLo0KPkg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 5_star	great authentic chinese dishes, need to know what to order. chicken wings and salt & pepper pork chops
NIE-8yclnFHvPpK0GHMoug	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Singapore Rice Noodles are fantastic, really! So ridiculously good that EVERY time I eat here I get them, and sometimes another dish just to say that I've tried other stuff. They will make the dish as large or spicy as you want (I often get an extra-large portion extra spicy - which is 1.5 times size of normal) but straight up off he menu is probably just as good. Most of their other dishes are good too, depends on what you like, but don't judge this place without trying the Singapore noodles. Ps, yes the decor is old & cheesy but at least it's clean, the staff (actually the cooks granddaughter I think) is super friendly, and you can always order as takeout. Pss, the very small almost gimmicky lunch buffet is not their best feature so don't eat that & think the menus items are the same.
4XLcAdBy9vkAfzbl_9K34Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This is a restaurant I go to because I am hungry, want good, healthy food, pleasant service and I try something new almost every time. May, the nice young lady who always has a smile and great suggestion is a 5 Star server. It's also a good idea to order some fried chicken to go once you finish your meal.
M7_789508jyoH80Y6i0PMA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Local greasy spoon restaurant - buffet was great if you like chinese food. If you want a renovated restaurant this place is not for you. You don't pay for the chairs you sit on but rather good food.
71FapP9qsbJ12xVu3RtJ1Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 5_star	New Hong Kong (as we call it) has been a family favorite for years. Now we go often with our friends for our weekly Sunday night dinners. It's a great family-run casual place that has authentic Chinese food at great prices. When we go we have an order set that we like: the West Lake soup, Peking pork chops, beef chow fun (dry), claypot with tofu and BBQ pork, and the beef and broccoli which you can do with either American or Chinese broccoli. They also have great chicken wings. Other dishes that we like include the walnut shrimp and the salt and pepper pork.
M1zrpWL9ODxOn06mKWglGg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	We have eaten at china village and had their takeout for 15 years. Love it. Mu shu is fun to eat in. Kung pao is good too. We can eat in with wheelchair access no problem. The bar is not in use, but I wish it was. It is tiki room cute. Very vintage look. Mai tais are cool.
C5afQREnVYBPb9jkNtITtQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	We are new to Yelp so I have never left a review, but it has been so helpful to us in the recent past, I feel compelled to start. I'm new to the neighborhood, so a good Chinese restauraunt is an important find. I was really happy with our experience with China Village the other night. We've been doing a lot of take out lately, and it's been hit and miss ( except with my Yelp leads), but the whole experience was satisfying. We called at 9:30pm and yet the food was fresh and the gal was very friendly. We just had basic Beef Brocolli, Lemon Chicken, Sweet/Sour Pork & Chicken Fried Rice, but it was very satisfying. And when I asked for hot mustard, they gave us the good stuff in little cups, not packets. Their dishes have a distinct flavor that is very good, not overwhelming at all, but not just the same old...
rz1sr6E6evomx9biinFNFQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Ok First time here today, Food was awesome staff was way cool and the lady that processed my credit card was hilarious lil old lady haha this is definitely the closest to NY - NJ Chinese i have had in a while im definitely going back to this place when i want food on the go Thanks China Village
zbB_a7tQjuFW1afdY3I2fg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	5 stars for customer service. This is our go-to place for Chinese take-out after having tried a bunch of places in our area. The food is consistent, standard Chinese-American, always hot, with fresh veggies. Tonight, though, I was prompted to write a review. I am vegetarian and my husband is a little picky, and as such I made asked for some substitutions to our order. I ordered Mooshoo vegetable with no egg (my preferece) and veggie fried rice with added tofu and no mushrooms (hubbie's preference after finding a rogue mushroom last time). Also ordered a few other items. 5 minutes later, China Village called back to double-check that I also didn't want egg in the fried rice since I had asked for it in the mooshoo. I thanked him for asking, and no, we did not want any egg in the rice. I went to pick up the order, and the sweet little lady at the counter told me that that also made sure to take the mushrooms out of our soup, since she was worried that we couldn't eat mushrooms and didn't want us to worry about finding them. They did not have to pay such close attention to details, and I wouldn't have complained if none of these things had occurred. But because they went the extra mile, my appreciation was far greater than my dissatisfaction would have been. Support this place and show them that customer service still means something!
PSquayMLXYYA_uBkTGOTZw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	China Village, I would like to award you 5 stars. My boyfriend and I are in love with you. Absolutely our go-to Chinese restaurant. Why do I love it so much? Well... The service is fantastic. Especially this one gentlemen that works there, that always seems to be wearing a bow-tie. He is friendly and funny, and I get excited whenever we are seated in his section. With that said, I don't want to take away from the other people that work there, because they are all awesome too. I am yet to have a sub-par experience with the staff. They start you off with complimentary hot tea and water. It's good tea too. It's unsweetened, but if you are like my boyfriend and need it sweet, there is sugar available of course. However, I like it as is. The food itself is wonderful. The first time I went, I had a spicy shrimp dish, served with steamed white rice. It had the perfect amount of kick, and there was just enough to fill me up and and then some to take home to enjoy later. My personal favorite dish though is the beef and broccoli. Definitely a classic, but the broccoli is always the perfect texture, and the sauce is so rich and the beef is always great for this dish. Usually we get the dinner combination that comes with a bowl of soup (also good), a crab puff, a chicken wing, and an egg roll. I usually trade my boyfriend the eggroll for the chicken wing, because they are each of our favorites. This place is great for a weeknight dinner out..... Well, really any dinner out, I'm gonna be honest. Or lunch for that matter. Actually, whenever you want to eat out, just go here :)
LlIYud-DrQUlTbrKCwnp4A	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Best Chinese place and the friendliest service. Yummy Mu shu chicken, rolled up vor you at the table. Inded , yhe service with the bowtie is a great assest (isn't he the owner?). Also, this is a place that listens when you request spicy. Just because you're white, a lot of restaurants will adjust the spicyness, not here they'll a comodate the customers wishes.
W2gDU4SLmW48Agy5B11Slw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I can't tell you how many times I have driven past this place without giving it a second thought. Today, I happened to be in the area and was craving a quick Chinese lunch. This is one of the friendliest places around, and the subtle aroma of fresh Chinese food wafts toward you as you enter. Seated immediately, I waited less than a minute for ice water and hot tea. I chose the General chicken. Spicy, crispy, full of flavor accompanied by crunchy egg roll and wontons. That hit the spot! Oh the soup was good too. Service was attentive but not hovering. Got out of there for eight bucks....score!
ksAsFqay75D4XrGJ765LyA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	By far the best chinese food in town with the friendliest staff. After a rough day yesterday i chose to go here over a high end scottsdale restaurant and was so glad I did. The food was amazing as it always is, the waiter made me laugh. I couldn't have asked for a better evening. I would highly recommend this place. Their house chicken is like a drug. Once you try it, your hooked. The sizzling beef plater is also a must. Give this a place a shot. You won't be dissappointed.
gIAA3qKAndtspTN--TwjjQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	A quick review: I bought two quarts of soup for carry out today, Egg Flower (like egg drop) & Hot and Sour. While I waited I was offer hot tea, which was a great gesture of customer service. Since I believe my order to be ready momentarily I declined the offer. The soups were piping hot and packaged to go not sooner after. The Hot and Sour definitely had more vegetables than I am used but was very hearty. The breakout star was definitely the Egg Flower soup as my mouth is extremely happy as this one also had a great deal of vegetables. Needless to say, I will return for dine in service very soon!
KYFtN7hezLaThxvbzlaNNQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Not so hidden gem indeed! Flashback to 1980? Right. Fantastic service? Check! What is better than drinking zombies and letting the sweet sounds of Billy Ocean flow over you? Killing Zombies or actually being by the ocean. But alas we are in a parking lot in 115 degree heat in Phoenix Arizona. China Village is wonderful, one of the few places I would take an out of towner to. Always solid food and prices. Have not been let down yet! Go China Village! Woohoo! As good as it gets! (in phoenix Arizona)
zuRt5uJSGa2rD8FZehxW1w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	VERY COOL PLACE. It looks like its right out of bladerunner or pulp fiction. The service is probably the best on the planet. The food is probably not the best but. The people are very nice. Order the moo shoo Its cool how the Waiter puts it together at your table. He calls it "Chinese burrito" I also like the garlic shrimp but its very garlicky.
tMnc_DRJRyc1Sou7TrfS6Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	We've been going to this restaurant for about 2 years now. As a little background story, it is family owned and operated. The family immigrated to the US but first spent some time in Vietnam, thus the Vietnamese dished on the menu in addition to the Chinese. The place is indeed a bit antiquated in decor but it really makes up for it in food-flavor. The best way to enjoy this place is to go there with a few people and eat the food family-style. Sometimes you get to sit in the big booth table with the lazy-Susan. The last time I was there, I sat with a group of 7 people and each person ordered a different dish. My favorites are the House-Chicken which is a lightly battered and fried, and then they pour a light sweet-soy type sauce over it. The hot and sour soup is also very tasty. You can order it extra spicy if you want. It has all kinds of veggies, and shrimp, pork and tofu as well. Another good choice is the fried rice they make: pork or house fried rice are quite delicious. Oh and I almost forgot the walnut shrimp. OMG! DELICIOUS!!!!!!! My pregnant sister can't have enough of that. The servers sometimes make fruit drinks that they hand out with crushed ice. I'm not sure if we get those because they know us or just because. We usually have water to drink so I can't comment on soda-pricing. The waiters/waitresses have accents because they were not born in the US. Some people should just get over that. I've been telling other friends about this place and I'll expect to go there again in the next few weeks.
Gh7VpZCU7xpsX2tA0UiOcA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Place has been here for decades. I've never had a bad meal here, and the wait staff are very very friendly. The food is excellent and they have the best hot and sour soup I've ever had!
iF4kretE7zBEQkZ-Pkgv7w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	The food is delicious!!!! My family and I all got a dinner special it comes with soup spring rolls chicken wings... a lot of food for like 13 bucks a person! Everyone is so friendly very chill atmosphere. I am definitely coming back.
aW8dPMQ9ZY6sZqYsJ7YyJQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	This place is delicious. The food is great and so is the service. The lunch special is a really good deal as well. I would recommend the Kung Pa chicken. It comes out piping hot. The location id great near Biltmore.
kPd3gDyNkB96_FsT7Bu4Jg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	My all-time favorite Chinese place in Phoenix. Been here over 20 times and never had a bad experience. The food is always spot on. The staff is friendly. Just a great place to go for lunch/dinner or even to go. Get the Schezuan Eggplant my favorite. I am a vegetarian so I get it without pork, which they have no problem modifying. Unlike Autumn Court down the street that threw a fit when I wanted no pork, something about it being a chef special! LOL. They also have AWESOME mai tais.
GNJBtPJY0lxrgIV2ZgQqHQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Five stars due to this being the best Panda Express I've ever visited. The girl behind the counter was polite to the person in front of me OFFERING samples to them. When I stepped up she was super polite to me and offered me samples as well, and thanks to the sample I ended up getting the honey sesame seed chicken. Absolutely delicious. I asked for both noodles and rice and I expected the usual half-assed scoops of both but this girl hooked it up big time on everything! Despite all these bad reviews I will definitely be a repeat customer!
ugxo0iHxlK1nPo-rM15u0g	Mc_Farland_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Awful, awful, awful... The worst of the worst of the cookie-cutter Chinese restaurants. Food without flavor, a menu without imagination and a staff of such profound indifference it's hard to tell they're even there.
k23vlH_rM4IwmRFrVmCOdQ	Mc_Farland_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Tried this because it's local. Terrible, bland Chinese food. Not much else to say. Will never return. My wife wanted me to mention her sweet and sour chicken, which was battered fried chicken pieces with a side of sauce in a bowl. When she asked where the vegetables were (like the picture), she was told there is a piece of pineapple in the sauce and that is what comes with it. As promised, we looked hard into the sauce and found one very small piece of pineapple. Bon Appetite.
OFwlRHVrbi_-5jk1j-JOlQ	Middleton_WI WI Party_&_Event_Planning Asian_Fusion Event_Planning_&_Services Venues_&_Event_Spaces Restaurants 1_star	This was, quite possibly, the WORST Chinese food (if you can call it that) that I've ever eaten in my life. We started with the appetizer platter for two. The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth. The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt. The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned. Then came the entrees. I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good. I was wrong. The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor. My boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu. He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions). The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible. Apart from the horrendous food was the tepid service. I had to ask several times for a glass of water. The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass. By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off. I tried to ask for some, but she walked away. Plus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack? Skip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door. On Fridays, they receive shipments of Pork Bao in from a bakery in Chicago that are to die for!
Oa_wOgiz8F1k_-dRow1Nhg	Middleton_WI WI Party_&_Event_Planning Asian_Fusion Event_Planning_&_Services Venues_&_Event_Spaces Restaurants 1_star	How do you get voted best of for 31 years when what is served is awful? This is the worst Chinese food my entire family has had in years. We all ordered different things and none of us could eat our meals. That was $50 wasted. There was no flavor, or the flavor there was did not match the dish. How do you mess up beef fried rice? I can make it with more flavor. The Mongolian beef had a flavor but it was all wrong. If you want to waste money and still be hungry, this is the place for you. How do places keep getting good reviews when they are so bad. I use to trust Yelp reviews but lately, I've been fooled by the reviews.
lRZUg6Wkqt5pamCVZjAwjg	Middleton_WI WI Party_&_Event_Planning Asian_Fusion Event_Planning_&_Services Venues_&_Event_Spaces Restaurants 1_star	Absolutely THE worst! This place won "Best of Madison" for Chinese food for how many years??? The judge must have been completely stoned out of his mind! Customer service: Very poor. The server never checked back until I went looking for her, wondering where our order was 50 minutes after ordering. Food finally arrived for our group of four--STONE COLD! Plates themselves were hot but practically frostbite on the food. Couldn't eat it. Manager came by, apologized and took 50% off the bill (!!!). Should have been 100% comped. I'm one of those folks who normally overlooks a lot and actually hates to complain, but this culinary travesty really needed to be reported. If this place previously had great food and service, then as of 2014 they've completely lost their "mojo".
Xj0bl0K4uKa2-ujs_vwkhw	Middleton_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Went there on Saturday night to get some food to go. On of the worst Chinese Buffets I've seen. Half of the trays were empty and other half were almost empty. Very little selection. The worst pay is the take out prices: $10.50 to get a to go box(should be under 2lb) and 40 cents for every ounce after, WTF is that!!! So we just went somewhere else that night and didn't dine there at all. Bottom line: EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE.
D4TVRqp5u21-VsAeN3LZEw	Middleton_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Not sure why I keep deciding to come back here. Rice is rock hard and has no flavor, along with most of the other food on the half-empty buffet trays. $10.50 for a plate of stale food and a drink that they forget to refill? No thanks.
fyU-fqtrFYJRWCm9yj57eA	Middleton_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I'm confused why anyone would choose to go here. To be clear, my expectations were that it would be an all Asian version of Noodles & Co. Cheap, decent, fresh food. Cheap - yep Decent - no Fresh - maybe at one point I ordered the Thai curry noodles. Not impressed. I've never tasted something that claimed to be curry with so little flavor. My vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish. Yuck. My boyfriend ordered the teriyaki udon, and the noodles were too skinny to be udon with the same flavor issues. Not even the chili garlic sauce did much to it. Chin's - good concept, but a waste of money even at $6.
MQnQoAoAuuFiKarBOI8FYg	Middleton_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	For what it is, a fast food Americanized Oriental restaurant, it's not overly bad, as long as you don't order shrimp. Service: I've never had a problem here. While not always the most outgoing service, they are friendly. My order is always ready in a decent amount of time. I've never dined in, so I won't comment on atmosphere. Their menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line. For the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. However, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. I pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch. Lesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs. **** I thought eventually I'd go back, but I haven't been since then. We had some of their food catered in for work, it was overcooked, rubbery, and chewy. yeah, next time I'll get my own lunch.
Invn_uxB3UBsju63mi0OPQ	Middleton_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away. On their menu it says $15 minimum. We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum. We found that insane so never ordered.
w42Xl54invO2DzX-9zIjMg	Middleton_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Only thing less disappointing then the food is the staff. Ordered Chin Wings, Hot & Sour soup and Sesame Chicken to go.. What I get in return is Chin Wings with the wrong stir fry sauce, a cup of hot & sour and lemon chicken. They charged me for what I ordered, yet they still refused a refund me or to replace my food.. Avoid this place like the plague.
wCJwGnOAqNeMK-O7F6ASjg	Middleton_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	The food was decent. But yet again, the staff managed to screw my order up and ended up charging me more then what I should of payed for.
gGNHUm6uxBuVM3RJB1n5bQ	Middleton_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I will never order from there again. I called to find out what was on the hot and spicy chicken. The person who answered informed me that it was both hot and spicy but it was serves with broccoli, snow peas and onions. Once I got my entree it was neither hot nor spicy. On top of that, there was no broccoli. Too many onions, barely any snow peas AND a very small amount of chicken. Did I mention that I don't think the chicken was actually chicken? It was cut so thin and had no chicken flavor. The white rice that accompanied my dish was mushy and clumped together. I've made better rice boiling it. My mom had the Kung pao chicken and she was also dissatisfied with her meal. The crab Rangoon was ok... Fairly basic. I won't return there. I would prefer to give it a ZERO
kERjFKM_K4FaG7ASmhfAOg	Sun_Prairie_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I was unhappy due to having to wait 55 minutes for my one meal (steamed veggies combo with chicken, shrimp and scallops! Then I get two pieces of shrimp, three small slices of chicken a few tiny scallops!! For $12.00 that is a rip off, a joke and unacceptable! You going to charge for food with those items in you better put more than sliced veggies!! I will never come back!
W5dYKsnII0ftLs5WePCDQA	Sun_Prairie_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	The rice and steamed vegetables were good, but that's about all we could tolerate. We ordered General Tso's, which is what we always get when we first try a Chinese restaurant. It helps us compare to other places.The quality of the chicken used was awful. The dumplings were flavorless. We will not be returning.
IKwqSgdyh7AQDtfDGCs6Dg	Sun_Prairie_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Blech. My brother heard this was the best Chinese buffet in Sun Prairie. Maybe that is true, but it must be the only Chinese buffet in Sun Prairie. I'm not giving it a hard time for "authenticity" or any of that eaither. I love me some good Americanized, crappy Chinese food. Here, even the stuff that was out fresh from the kitchen (which was mighty slim picken's) was barely edible. I was really looking forward to some good old MIdwestern Chinese buffet, too. The Chinese food options in Portland are actually very lacking, the last really good stuff I had was from a strip mall in Crawfordsville, IN. Seriously, they can do it right but everyone else serves lukewarm, tasteless piles of mystery? Gotta be kidding me. Most options seemed to have been sitting for way too long when we got here, and it was peak dinner eating time. I should have been tipped off by the low number of patrons at this "best Chinese" but I like to give the benefit of the doubt. You are better off making Ramen noodles at home and calling it chinese food.

G-xpsSs_fvsy4JYDfny6MQ	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Note: This review is location-sensitive. I called the wrong location (Sun Prairie) when I needed delivery to east Madison. To THEIR credit, the girl there was incredibly nice and gave me the new number of the east side location. Rude employee, Bad food, Bad service. Will never order from them again. However, when I called the Commercial Street location, a gentleman answered, with incredibly loud music in the background causing me to barely understand the questions I expected. He asked for the necessary delivery info and what I wanted. I asked him which would be easier for him, the numbers or titles of what I wanted (given that I looked online prior to calling) and he replied with 'whatever, no both'. I started my order and he corrected me rudely telling me I wasn't referring to the correct numbers, that they belonged to another store (there's only one website). After taking my order, he took my card number, said it would be 45 minutes, and hung up. The delivery man was very cordial, however, the food was the worst Chinese I've ever had (Order: Crab Rangoon, Chicken Fried Rice, Pork Egg Roll, General Tso's Chicken) - the chicken and rice was dry, the general tso's was mostly fried dough, the crab rangoon had overpowering green onions and the fortune cookie stale. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
KoM8eQCHb8qgfem5PAJzVA	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Was not feeling well yesterday so I ordered some food online for delivery from Chang Jiang. Originally I though I had enough cash to pay for the order but realized as I was finishing my online order I'd have to pay by credit card. I took the $23 and threw on the table next to the door so I could tip in cash. When the guy delivered,BTW he was in my neighbors driveway about 2 feet into his lawn, I grabbed what I though was a $3 tip. Woke up this morning and realized that I had given him $23 instead of 3. I forgot to remove the $20 bill when I handed him the cash. I didn't look at it, like I said, I was sick. I called this morning to and began the conversation with him like this " Hi, you delivered food to me yesterday on ____ St. and I think I may have mistakenly given you too much for the tip. He started yelling in to the phone that I gave him a $3 tip not a $23 dollar tip. He was ranting and raving. The weird part is that I had not even said the amount I though I had mistakingly tipped him. I was talking calmly and he was ranting that I also had stolen his pen from him(a 20 cent pen!) Why would someone react like that to a simple inquiry??I was not accusatory, I was simply inquiring. And then for him to say he wanted to come over and pick up the pen I had taken from him? WTF? Ever heard of Karma dude?
jFMeudYNUDzeLz5r6ZDhRg	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Got some take-out from there based on the reviews on this site. Quite expensive and very low quality, like what one would expect from the crummy delivery places around here but not delivered and costing as much a a nice meal other places. I usually think the 'good' chinese places have decent hot and sour soup, this stuff was the thick inedible slop straight out of a cheap buffet. I dunno if I was expecting too much but this certainly did not deliver.
8pzCa9g940pNlXO1BxkAkg	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This is the worst Chinese food I have had could not even finish meal...ordered general tso's chicken with egg roll. I do not recommend this place.
WFpU1WJL8Wtv7Wn7oL3VJg	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Nice decorations and inerior, that's about it. The waitress is not helping at all for selecting good menu. They are charging for hot tea and pepper oil.(I guess they need to do that recover from investing for the interior.) Go ahead cross the street and go to the food court in the mall. They have better service and half lower price for the better food.
jggRxFoFiou1e6uJ39z4AA	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Lame, I didnt have very high expectations but had heard a very good things and I was not impressed. The bartender told me everything was fresh and prepared in house and made to order. After I ordered the food came out literally within 1-3 mins so I know for a fact that it was not fresh or made to order. To be honest I would have been more satisfied with food court chinese/asian food. Sad comparison i know, but true. I would not eat there again.
X5zR-lKRsXzxFiASrR-juw	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Not sure why this place has so many good reviews as the food is not Chinese! I'm a Chinese girl myself and I know how Chinese food should taste like. And this place does not have the authentic Chinese taste, in fact, it is a mixture of American, Thai and Chinese altogether which makes me disappointed. However, what makes me even more disappointed was when I ordered beef lo mein, The waiter was too busy chitchatting with guests and put in pork lo mein instead. When I called him back (it was a takeout order) he was saying it was his mistake and will credit that for my future order and refused to replace it! I was like, really? Definitely will not come back and not recommend this place to friends and family!
1XMQu45ivKndK4NBCAzKqQ	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Ordered food for delivery at a local hotel after 8 hours on the road. Gave all details of where we were staying and after an hour and 15 minutes got a call asking why we had not picked up our food. Were told there was no indication on the order that it was delivery! Terrible miscommunication at their end! When food arrived it was cold and not one fork or napkin in the bag. Very frustrating for hungry weary travelers...be careful if you are ordering delivery from this place!
Nn5YBs_AzEqK5z4BYBFKWA	Madison_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This is really only a half-revue, because I never ended up eating here due to the following: I got their menu in the mail and it looked good, so I went to see the place. The building exterior should have been a big red warning, it was grungy. Walking up to the front door you notice the absolutely filthy windows that are so dirty and smeared you cant really see through them. I went in and noticed all of the pealing wall paper and filthy floor corners and table feet, then there was the terrible smell permeating the place of rancid fishy frying grease, it almost made me sick--I had to leave. This place is dirty! I have worked in food long enough to know that if the front of the house is this bad then the kitchen is going to be ten times worse. These people clearly have scraped this place together to try and make a buck and nothing else. I find it mind blowing that this "restaurant" can even get a passing score from the Dane Co. Health Dept.
GDt2y1efsR01H7RTsxXvbw	Monona_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I was in town for business and got back to my hotel around 7PM (dinner time). Having work to do for my client, I decided that I would order food to be delivered to my room and chinese food sounded great! I ordered General Tso's Chicken, a small Pork Lo Mein, and the fried dumplings. I thought I was in for a treat as I don't often get the chance to have chinese food. Little did I know, that the food about to be delivered from Taste of China @ 5415B Monona Dr, Monona, WI was horrible. The chicken smelled a little different, but when i tasted it I could tell that it had been left out on the counter for hours instead of being in a cooler prior to preparation. The pork lo mein was OK, so I ate some of it and the dumplings were edible. The next day, I was sick all day. I called the resteraunt and complained when I got back to the hotel and they offered to replace my order. No way was I going to go for round two of the food poisoning game. Instead I told them that I would be posting this review and reporting them to the health department. DO NOT EAT THERE!! YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY THAT YOU DID!!
fNlp7h3eRtJYQCy1kx7ZdA	Monona_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Gross. Went to Noodles for lunch on a Saturday, place was not busy. Bathroom was disgusting. Dirty floor and wet. No paper towels. Smelled. Plates and bowls (all of them) were chipped. Not sanitary.
lb_yNbc0VwjEuE0ydxaFoQ	Monona_WI WI Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I won't be returning. Today, I picked up an order for my friend and I. They read back the order and it was exactly what it should be, but when I got to work, they had not put a rice krispie bar in even though they charged us for it. Additionally, my Japanese Pan noodle bowl left much to be desired. The carrots were uncooked (even though they were supposed to be) and "topped with cilantro" means one slimy spring of cilantro with 2 leaves on it. My friend's pasta was burnt. Burnt! While I like Noodles & Company in general, this location is lacking.
C85618PrjV1lUBUyWaFksA	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(New) Nightlife Dance_Clubs Restaurants 1_star	My female best friend and I were in town for the night, road-tripping. It seemed like a nice place inside - totally empty, but it was late and a weeknight, so I didn't think much of it. I didn't have much of a problem with drinks, or service until later that night... and that's why I'm taking the time to give this place a 1-star review. This is a review about a certain bartender, whose name my friend and I never got, but he said he was Chinese and Colombian. The area seems to close down early.... even though there seemed to be a basketball game getting out. The bartender said he was closing up early, directed us to another bar (closed when we got there) hand we found a place nearby. Shortly after, the same bartender showed up at the bar, started drinking with us. I don't remember much about the conversation, except for some lies this guy was telling us, saying that he was running the bar after two weeks of working there, that he didn't live in Phoenix, he lived in New York - later, he forgot that he said that, and told us he lived in the same city in California that we did. By the time the bar closed, I was getting pretty sloshed, and he proceeded to invite himself to our motel room (I thought my friend invited him, and my friend thought I did), and by the time we got to my friend's car, he insisted I sit in the back seat. I'll skip some details here, and make a long story short: I puked on the ride home, so I spent the rest of the night sobering up. The Chinese/Colombian guy kept pushing weed and beer on my friend (who's a lesbian, by the way) and when you're a man, you can tell when a guy is being a sleazeball and trying to get into a girl's pants. It became blatantly obvious that he was waiting for me to pass out so he could do what he wanted, and so I forced myself to stay awake. Again, I'm skipping on a lot of detail here, because Yelp really isn't the place for that. After he had long overstayed his welcome (which was never offered in the first place), my friend went to the bathroom, and I mustered all the civility I had left to ask him to leave as nicely and non-offensively as possible. To this, he insisted that unless I reimbursed him for the pot and beer he brought (neither of which I personally imbibed) he didn't have to leave. I bit my tongue. Shortly after, I could hear him talking about me outside when he and my friend were having a cigarette. I snapped, had to get rude with him, pulled my friend inside and slammed the door in his face. The point of this whole review is this: Ladies, watch out for this sleazeball bartender. He'll try to get into your pants by the most disrespectable means.
xFobV8CutwsmYf61eUeDqw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I've hesitated to write about Fate. I always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00. We've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it. I'm not really high on the "this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco. I don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons. The server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult. Anyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- "the food here is terrible... and such small portions!" I'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. Anyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it.
fgJXyg7T3rga9ZRRD89EaA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This is one of those places that really pisses me off. The food is very good, the beer is even better, and the atmosphere is super-cool. It's just the type of place we need more of in downtown Phoenix. It's even open late! Unfortunately I have to give it one lonely star because the service so often SUCKS. More than once I'v been told that because I don't have a reservation I'd have to wait up to 45 minutes despite the fact that the place was less than 50% full. The final straw was in the middle of July, when I was asked to "please wait outside" for my table. Are you kidding me? The food ain't THAT good.
ggwFa7EH10tbONGcnVRYww	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Sometimes I think that people are willing to let ANYTHING slide in order to avoid chain restaurants. That is why Fate is so successful. Fate has the rudest staff and worst "wait" policy of any restaurant in town. The worst part? They make no apology for making you wait OUTSIDE for a table in 110 degree weather. Are they on crack? Outside??? The whole bar is empty...yet patrons are relegated to the hot dirty front yard. Why do you make people wait outside when you are empty? One time I went there and only TWO tables were occupied. They told us there would be a 20 - 30 minute wait. I asked why there is a wait as nearly ALL the tables were open. The dumb girl at the door kind of shrugged and said they weren't enough waiters. So there aren't enough waiters to handle THREE tables instead of two??? At least let us wait INSIDE. Despite the place being empty the mean lady told us to wait outside. I said NO THANKS. and stormed off NEVER to return. FATE IS MY WORST DINING EXPERIENCE IN ARIZONA SO FAR. Fate is less than 1 mile from my house, so it saddens me it isn't a place I can call home.
YFCoK8arC81TR1RHvseUNQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I went to Fate because I had been hearing from people for a really long time that it was just a fantastic place and I really should try. It happened to be right by the Roosevelt where we were actually going to meet up with some of you Yelpers. You know who you are people. Hi guys! It was fun! We parked and walked up and went inside. The decor was nice. It seemed to have a decent atmosphere but I am not the type to be suckered in by all that crap. If a place sucks, I don't care how chic the atmosphere is. I will call a spade a spade. The place wasn't full, quite the opposite really. Maybe 2 or 3 tables were occupied. So we go up to the hostess and tell her we'd like a table for two and she says that it'll be about 5 minutes which I am fine with but when I ask her if we can wait in inside she says "No. Please wait outside." What the fuck is that about? I could understand if they were super busy and they didn't have any open tables for us to even sit at putting us in the way but if it weren't for the damn techno-look-at-me-I'm-cool music they were playing, you could hear crickets chirping in this joint. Strike one! So we go outside and wait. She comes out after awhile and gives some other people that are waiting some drinks then tells us she'll be right back after she goes and grabs a couple of menus. They must keep the menus in the parking lot or something because it took her awhile to come back. She sits us in this corner that's pretty much hidden away from everything. So here we are eating in a restaurant that I'm convinced people go to only to be seen and here we are not being seen. Oh woe is me! Woe, woe, woe is me! However will I earn my cool points for the month? The waitress was very nice and attentive. I'll give them that but god damn could they keep this place any darker. I realize it adds ambiance but when you're struggling to read the damn menu it's a little much. Strike two! We order a couple of $4 Republic of Teas and the pot stickers then proceed to peruse the rest of the menu. The variety is somewhat lacking and a common theme is sweetness. As anyone who knows me will tell you, I don't do sweet. So I order the Cantonese Dragon Beef and my significant other orders the Szechuan Chicken. The waitress comes back with the pot stickers. They sucked. They were identical to the ones you get at Costco. They are just like the ones they serve at Casey Moore's during happy hour only there they're free. Here they cost $6. I eat one and that's it. Strike three! Then comes the entrees. Decent sized portions. I can't really tell you if the presentation was good because it was so damn dark in there but I'll just give them the benefit of the doubt on that one. Mine was in a word, crap. The best thing you could say about it is that it tasted weird. I didn't even like the mushrooms. I am a mushroom fanatic. If there are two things on a menu that both look awesome and one has mushrooms and the other doesn't, the mushrooms always tip the scales. But they didn't even save this dish. I am beginning to think the baseball metaphor wasn't the best route to go as here we are already at strike four. So in my disappointment I decide to give my girlfriends Szechuan Chicken a try. Baseball was definitely not the way to go because we're at strike five now. So now my only option is the white rice that came with the dish. This thankfully was perfectly adequate. Now if I go to a fucking CHINESE restaurant and the best compliment I can give the food is "At least they didn't fuck up the rice", we are in some ugly territory here people. If you're looking to go to some hip chic place cuz you want to here the latest spins from DJ Such and such, skip Fate, hit up Hunan Express and then just go straight to Myst or Drift or where ever the shiny shirts happen to be on that given night. Nuf sed.
ZWNT9I9QagDxjwp5PtQRyw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Stay away. Far away. I had been hearing about Fate for a while. I had high expectations, since I had been to Lucky Dragon in the past (the owners prev joint) which was OK. It was the worst Chinese/Asian I've had in AZ, the service was terrible, the chairs uncomfortable, and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning.... and has been sick for the last 2 days from it. I took her to the ER this morning at 4:30 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since I've been a lurker for a while. Aesthetics: Initially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city. Nice patio, cool inside. However... The seating at a bus stop is more comfy. There is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your back. I'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the Hot and Sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share. However, they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil, so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine. WTF? Service: I don't know a nicer way to say it, our waitress was a dopey bimbo. It took 20 minutes for her to take our order. She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass, and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some. Not good. Food: I ran into a friend there, and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it. To be blunt, it was utter crap. The hot and sour soup was thin and spicy. That's it. It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present. It's not like any hot and sour soup I ever had.... in a bad way. There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg. I ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef, she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofu. My dish was bad. The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy, and totally lacked flavor. As for basil, there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish, and that's it. The sauce was thin and one dimensional. Her lemon grass dish was also bad. The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water. I felt bad for the poor abused tofu. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.... but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste. Screw that, even the chinese place in the mall food court is better. I am not exaggerating. It was a very disappointing meal. Now for the nasty part. I drank water - Fiancee unit drank th 'Green Tea.' It was like no other green tea I ever had seen. It was leprechaun green, with some kind of milk like substance in it.I thought it looked kinda funky, but she drank it. It was the only difference between our meals. I tried hers, she tried mine, etc. I didn't drink the science experiment tea. Well... Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains. She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea. 2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm. I took her to the ER at 4:30 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning. Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now, but come on. This shouldn't be the end result. Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems, if you know what I mean, due to lifestyle choices. There is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix. Maxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave. The Cultural Center has a few great places, esp Golden Buddha. Thai Lahna has been consistently good for years. Like I said I don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food quality.
B613lHQDA6sQE-LYoj7hrQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I haven't yelped in about 2 months, and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me. Well, this place was that bad. First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice. No beers on tap though; and seriously, what's with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm? Come on guys, way too early for that. It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, that's right, no menus yet, good job. O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles. Seriously?! Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in. Yuck. And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice. I'm sorry, isn't it supposed to be the other way around? My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless). So yeah, I don't recommend this place. Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food.
TPuB28F6vMZes3Bux_Mg8g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I hate Fate! My fate at Fate has always been to have a mediocre meal that takes too long. Don't even bother with a group as it only makes the servers even more surly than normal and the food even slower to arrive. The last time I was there, I was with a group (bad idea, per my comment above). Several folks asked that their food be prepared mild. When the food came, every dish on the table was nuclear hot. I can handle hot food, but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos. When we mentioned this to our server, she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time. She patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary (Duh!), but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food. Therefore, the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency. Frankly, any chef who doesn't taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of work. The concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great. Sadly, Fate falls apart in its execution. It's a lot less flashy, but you get a consistent meal at China Chili where they also know how to regulate the heat in their food. Apparently their chefs actually taste their dishes.
Hz7RZd6rp9lW3Su-Ylp9lw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	First of all, Johnny Chu should be ashamed to call himself a chef. He is barely a line cook. As stated in previous reviews, he doesn't even taste his own food (which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visits). So, I made reservations, thinking I may be able to sit at the bar because I arrived 10 minutes early. Wrong. I was ordered to wait outside. Nearly 45 minutes later, and a drink at the bar next door, I inquired about my table. The girl didn't even look up at me to acknowledge I had said anything. After a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me, she finally said my table was ready. Hmm. The food is horrible. I fear those of you who enjoy it, rather enjoy the "atmosphere" and come here to be seen. The food is either completely bland (e.g., my curry, which tasted of water with a slight hint of something I couldn't even recognize) or so hot as to mask any possible flavor. By calling themselves "authentic Asian" cuisine is just silly. There are so many hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants that could cook Chu under the table blindfolded. So, the rude, nonexistent service, the insanely overpriced food, and to be seen is what you're paying for. If you enjoy being treated like shit and fed food that I wouldn't feed in a troth for pigs--you may enjoy this place and good for you!
8znG7jU6Lqb5Tkqjfv4v0g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Fate has great food, but lacks on every other level. I live three blocks away so its upsetting to see a place with so much potential fail.
rugqluCMXCX7IpjMt6L69Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	hey fate. you were better when you were that hole in the wall on university called lucky dragon. boo. nastiest food ever.
hZg-lc40mZgyBelZEjVw6Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I've eaten here many times in the past few years, and the food was always fabulous. Not so this last time. The food was AWFUL. I assumed that Johnny Chu was still the chef, so I emailed him to ask him what was up with the food, only to find out that he is no longer there, which may explain the awful food. After having eaten here seven or more times, I won't be back.
e5yBMo3znROS_vj4dcnzFw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I went to the newly renamed 9/05 with a group under the recommendation that they did their tofu dishes really well and catered towards vegetarian foods. I guess the tofu itself was decent; thick, firm and textured, but the curry (which had been vaunted as one of the best dishes) fell completely flat. Where was the spice? Where was the flavor?? Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked? To add insult to injury, everyone else at the table who had ordered the Pad Thai and Bangkok Dynamite dishes sniffling and complaining about the spiciness of their food. "I'm Mexican" whispered one lady "I LOVE spice, but this is too much with the chili flakes". At the end of the meal there was plenty of leftover food which everyone declined to take home. The entrées started at 10$ and so did the drinks, I was priced out of ordering one of their 15$ "martinis" and stuck with a four dollar beer. The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again. Someone mentioned that ownership changed hands with the name changing, maybe the good cooks left as well?
zsWcJTuoJjuGauGOofMwYQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	My love affair with Fate ended when Johnny left. The service, quality and atmosphere took a total nose dive. Go to Sens instead.
ADzxDN3riDWzjpXeSU19wQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	All I can say about Fate is 'yuck' That's it.
Ab8XPrgAGOVMRq_EL9SOYw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This used to be on my very short list of "favorite" restaurants. Everything was perfect - except the Pad Thai (I am a traditionalist when it comes to Pad Thai and it's not realy Pad Thai at fate, the noodles and the sauce are wholly different). The crab puffs were amazing, the ambiance was clever and appropriately aloof/warm. I even enjoyed the loud music next door, the bar was comfortable - and the scene was young and nutty., Loved it. I am sad to see this place die out. I have NOT visited FATE since SENS opened up - I was hoping SENS and FATE would do some joint marketing and certainly there was enough interest for them to work as a team - but alas, FATE moved on without Jonny and that was a huge mistake. See my review of SENS. That place just keeps getting better and better. I am addicted. We go very often and enjoy everything about the people and the food.
gUWlrTwBlEn1tZYw9X7hRQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I really want to like this place. Their food is delicious - the crab puffs are addicting and melt in your mouth. Unfortunately the service is terrible. It takes forever to get a drink at the bar on weekend nights, which is the only time to go since it is dead during the week. On First Fridays they don't take reservations past a certain time and then you have to put your name on a list. Each time I've put my name on this list they have crossed it off without trying to locate me, as I sit waiting for my party's name to be called right in front of the door. I then have to argue with the hostess to get back on the list to wait again.
M1t5GWbglRHG81JrXtcqsA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Restaurants 1_star	This is the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever been to. Here is a list of problems: 1. Too expensive for a hole in the wall. I ordered two entrees, fried rice, egg rolls and two beverages. The bill was $32.30 2. The egg roll was not an egg roll, it looked like a giant size deep fried hot pocket. 3. I asked the waitress if we could return the egg roll because it was not what I was expecting. I didn't even have a single bite. She told me it was already served to me so she wouldn't remove it from the bill. It was $3.50. It's not like I was asking for some special VIP treatment or asking for my meal to be comped. 4. To end my dinner, there was a cricket crawling on the wall behind me. That killed my appetite. Also the place looked like a dump. The ceiling looked like it had water damage. The whole place was trashy looking. In conclusion, the food wasn't good, customer service was horrible, and the place is a dump -both inside and out. EFF this place!!!!
0Oo2g6ZPPvnQr_HE_U6gnQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	The food is blah. I ate there for a long time just because it is the closest Asian restaurant, but really the food could be better.... OK, it could be a lot better. A long time ago, I used to love their frog legs, but now they are so bad I cant even tell you. The abundance of sauce ruined the crispiness of the frog legs. I was so disappointed! They raised their prices by 50% or more on some dishes & sides. Some of the prices have almost doubled. For example, the small rice was $1. Now, it's $1.50 extra. The large was $2. Now, it's $3.50. It is something stupid but still annoying. Also, it is hard to order food from them over the phone... To tell you the truth I sometimes have trouble ordering food from them there because they dont seem to be able to communicate very well in English. And you always have to double check your order. The food is inconsistent. It's not great but it's food and still fairly inexpensive. I wont bother eating there again because their food keeps getting worse & worse. I have had 2 friends get sick from their food. Watch out for their chicken! My friend said he got undercooked chicken from this place. Also, They wont give out copies of their to-go menu with the new prices on it. So you kinda just have to take their word for it on the new prices... It used to be a place we went often but it's getting to the point that I'm kinda just over this place. Yah, the more I think about it, I'm way over this place.
-XCFeZJcsAkvSq4fpuyNzQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Ok - so I used to live minutes from china town in NYC... so I'm perhaps a little spoiled. I realize that. I still have not found a Chinese food place here in phoenix that I'm crazy about...I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm not gonna. That being said... this is by far the *worst* Chinese I've had here so far. They are right around the corner from where i live so i decided to give it a try for take out one night... they got our order wrong, it took forever, and it was completely flavorless... I had a few bites and lost my appetite. Maybe I ordered the wrong things... maybe I was there on an off night... who knows. But as far as I'm concerned - Vegetable lo mien shouldn't be that difficult to get right. My boyfriends meal (forget what he got) was no better. I won't be going back. Its a real shame too since the location is ideal for me....
SNsTEznsD2iZD4YmUgiNdQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This is my uncle's favorite Chinese place in Phoenix...and I have no idea why. It's a little junk Chinese food spot...but it begs the question: "Isn't Junk Chinese at least supposed to taste good?" I mean, I know what I'm putting into my body isn't actually good for me, but Gourmet House of Hong Kong makes the act of eating it not even pleasurable...so what exactly is the point? The spot isn't very clean (the bathroom=complete ew). The noodles are gummy, the tofu is rubbery...The sweet and sour sauce was kind of good, but I think it added to my stomach ache (which began mid meal). The crunchy things they'll give you if you ask--those are good. Crunchy things and a semi-doable sweet and sour do not a restaurant going experience make.
YmqGMkungk3MLrRk8JoPhg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Ekkk! We went here after reading great reviews and seeing that it was one of The Arizona Republic's top 10 chinese spots in the Valley. Nothing was good, I'm sad to report. The sweet and sour soup had such an odd overly bitter taste, it really wasn't edible. I ordered their version of Happy Family and the "spicy brown sauce" was watery, sweet and made the veggies soggy. My husband ordered the bell pepper chicken, which was just OK. We got our order to go, otherwise I would have sent the soup and my dish back. And maybe would have had a different experience... We've had such a hard time finding a good traditional chinese place in Phoenix.
nf7ZNiEHLKA5OvRsXRJUDQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Mu Shu was closed so we gave this place a try for takeout. Sundays and Asian food, I know. I'm Asian. Currently suffering worst food poisoning in this decade, the kind that tears your back up from violent heaving. Don't get chicken.
eVKjzPlMKFkr7QLyIPCEZg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Not a fan. Had the sesame chicken lunch combo and did not like it at all. The soup if a veggie and if you want egg drop it's a $1.00 more, the fried rice has nothing fried it's just yellow rice. The chicken was hard and the sauce wasn't good. It was just not a good experience.
5snF8ssP1NF05lriXDLMNg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	So I thought reading their menu, seeing it in Chinese language and in the Chinese District . . . it could be a real find -- I love dives with surprisingly good food. I was soooooo disappointed. The egg drop soup was vegetable soup and just warm. A minute after my soup was served, my main course came out. It had two items--pea pods and pork. Not very BBQ flavor, rather a funny flavor. No other veges such as water chestnuts or bamboo shoots. The minimal sauce was very bland. The rice was not fresh.
dq6bszOpxzcHFWMyXCKDiA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I have been here on two occasions and both times their crab puffs were cold in the middle (probably fried from being frozen, not fresh). Their beef lo mein had a strange flavor to it, did not like the sauce. And their sesame chicken was unlike any other I've had at other Chinese restaurants. My concern is the freshness of the ingredients: seems like they are either using frozen or canned. This place would be a hit if they just went to a grocery store every day and only cooked the freshest ingredients cooked to order. The kitchen seems busy and adequate enough, but the restaurant seating area is empty (at least the two times I went there). I get the impression that this is a large family-owned restaurant that has gotten lazy over the years. Gordon Ramsay needs to pay a visit.
azR-_KV1lqWOFSBN7Yg49g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Hot and sour soup had a gallon of vinegar Mongolian beef had a pound of sugar Gross, gross, gross. Thank god we only stopped by while road tripping.. Ick Update: im close to throwing up from that gross taste of sugary (whatever the hell they used in that "mongolian beef" sauce). Seriously it was chunks of leathery meat swimming (really) in gross brown syrupy sauce. With several pathetic pieces of onions. Thats it, folks. Thats mongolian beef for the ghetto house of hong kong. This is not chinese food. No, this should not even be food.
RKwtPClkbgd3yN_bhLvRtA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Shopping_Centers Shopping Outlet_Stores Chinese Restaurants 1_star	If the Chinese economy has a "hard landing," it will look like Cofco Cultural Center. Most of the storefronts are empty. There's one gift store, woefully declaring "yes, we're open!" There are restaurants on either side of Ranch Market that may be the same restaurant with different names. The architecture is pretty in a "Disney does China" way, but it's essentially a strip mall with a high vacancy rate, anchored by a supermarket.
4xdfcdhZSShne6aIVp1cMA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Ugh. My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good. But I was craving Chinese, I work near the COFCO center, and it was threatening to rain. I scanned the menu, found Kung Pao chicken, and ordered up. They told me 5 minutes, and they were accurate. Price was reasonable. Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated. Food was inedible. I got the lunch special, which include soup, egg roll, entree and fortune cookie. I couldn't eat any of it. The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour. I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it. I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma). The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat. The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken. I watch too many movies. The egg roll was just gross. It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep-fried. The fortune cookie was stale, and the fortune was even lame. I would've done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express.

JDhZTy8FiYxFdMl9Jll4wQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Alex A. was craving some Chinese food, so we headed over to the Chinese Cultural Center and decided on trying Lao Ching Hing. I should first say that I'm from an area that's saturated with Chinese restaurants, so I have pretty high standards for Chinese food. Lao Ching Hing fell far short of those standards. At first glance, it seemed like a pretty nice restaurant. They invested a lot in very nice traditional-looking furniture, which I don't see often. So I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the place. We were the only patrons when we went, so I can't really complain of bad service since we were the only ones being served. We ordered the stir-fried string beans (my all-time favorite dish) and the salt and pepper pork. They were both so bad :( The string beans were under-seasoned and not really cooked the way it should have been cooked. In that particular dish, the beans should have been dried. It seems like they sort of skipped that step or didn't complete that step. So instead of nice crunchy beans, we got squeaky beans. The pork chops were worse though. I'm thinking it was at least a day old - you could taste the old oil - and they probably just re-heated it (we definitely heard a microwave go off). And that old oil taste stayed in my mouth long after dinner was over. Not pleasant. I think Panda Express has better-quality food than this place. I will not be returning.
oicRBv_bksRH_TzDJHmqtA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Reading the other reviews here makes me think I must have landed in a parallel universe the night we ate here. OK, so I'm a Bay Area native and love Sichuan food; I'm white and my girlfriend is Asian. We walk in the door, are seated, and handed the simple menu. NOTHING of interest on the menu. We decided on two very basic dishes (General Chou's Chicken and a Sichuan Prawm dish). The Chicken was atrocious - dry, old-tasting, and nothing but a pile of chicken - no vegetables, no spice, nothing. The shrimp dish was marginally better, but nothing to write home about. Meanwhile, everyone at other tables seemed to be ordering stuff that we didn't see on the menu ... "maybe there's a Chinese menu we didn't see" we said to each other ... On our way out, we saw the 'Chinese' menu ... full of the stuff we were looking for - "pigs stomach with jalapeno", etc . So - I'm willing to believe they have good food, but - WHY oh WHY have a separate 'whites' menu? AND - when a white guy walks in with an Asian lady, WHY not give them the 'Asian' menu? The 1 star accurately reflects the food we ate, and also applies to the waiter who did not think to offer us the appropriate menus. We'll probably head back to Chandler for our next Chinese food experience.
B_vDdefxz25gd5FqCH6hEg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Tried the kung pao shrimp and veg chow mien. Nothing great. Service was also not good. Although I did go just before it closes. Even then I asked if you guys are still serving and would have been more than satisfied if they denied service. Looking at all the reviews. I might just try it again. But for now.... NOT Satisfied.
q3Tk4Es_UYnB_XBc3RUgAg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	So after reading all these reviews I thought to take a chance so I went to explore. I arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately. The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized. I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup. I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no. I chose the fried rice vs white or brown. Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it. On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked. The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce. Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland. The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste. The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce. I will not be returning to this place.
9l9qX-QtdE0EcqM9b11N4A	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This is the first restaurant that I have seen that is open until exactly 9:15pm. It is an odd closing time and maybe they were in a rush at 8:45pm packing my to-go order because my two spring rolls at $2 were left out. The dipping sauce for those spring rolls were in there and that ended up getting dumped on the white rice that was included with my noodle dish which is also unusual. So, I tried rice noodles with beef, but rice noodles in this joint are not Singapore style (which I wanted), but instead were chow fun style whic is like american egg noodles basically. The english spoken by the front counter owner was not perfect and she also seemed in a rush to make that crazy 9:15 time a reality. Ok, so the noodles and the onions and scallions in the dish tasted like any other place, but the nasty, unedible and in some pieces uncooked (9:15?) pieces of beef really earned this place its one star. I order beef like once in three years in Chinese places knowing that every place usually sucks and this was no exception. The owner could have mentioned that i could have gotten all veggies, but she didn't when I questioned her and I didn't figure out on the long menu that i could have gotten the same dish for $7.95 with no disgusting beef on the American side of the menu instead of paying a buck more. There must be an asian TV show that starts at 9:30pm or something because I doubt you will ever see a 9:15pm closing time ever again. I think the show is called "food no Good"
QqLnIPeH5mwsEkHCu4XxxA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Went in and was promptly seated. Someone came over and dumped water in our cups (with attitude) and walked away. 15 minutes later no one had come to get our order, others who sat down after us had ordered already. Felt like maybe we were not served because we were not asian, as almost everyone else in the restaurant was. Cant say for sure,. The only time anyone talked to us was to ask if there were two for dinner before we sat down. Disappointed because we were really looking forward to trying something different and authentic (menu looked good) - ended up walking out and going to tempe marketplace for dinner instead. Apparently they didn't want to serve us.
sZr3J0e0BbuqpZtgHuxWKQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Horrible service and bland, tasteless food!
eXQGm5nTV5S7xBRClM2BXQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Went there for lunch on 9/6/2013. When we walked in the man at the front desk seemed uninterested and told us to seat ourselves. We started to settle into a spot but got interrupted by a waitress who then seated us. Make up your mind people. Menus came fast but without a drink order, we were both very thirsty as it was over 100 out side. We also had to wait a bit long for the food order. The staff seemed to pointedly ignore us and walk past our table again and again. Our waitress eventually came to check on us but was so intent on speedily asking a quick question she started to walk away without a drink order again, we had to stop her. Food came promptly, with our drinks, but it tasted so so at best, about take out quality. We chugged through the waters and soda very quick but the empty glasses sat at the edge of the table until we finally had to hold up an empty glass and yell over for someone to bring refills. Rude yes, but nothing else got any kind of attention. After we were done, yep you guessed it, waited forever for the check. No excuse for a place with people at only 10% of the tables. Another big issue: They have a yelp coupon for checking in, even though it was presented at time of ordering, they WOULD NOT HONOR IT!! Bad service, so so food and dishonest representation. And we had been trying to get there for a long time. At least it was cheap. Update: We were contacted by the manager regarding the coupon not being honored. They said it was only for the dinner service. Problem is, the coupon did NOT state that. This makes it false advertising and constitutes fraud in my book. Its called "bait and switch" draw them in with a false ad. That only makes me feel worse about this place, can I take the one star back?
sL1cnQ9FbZEumka2TlahSA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Horrible experience. We ordered 3 entrees. General Tsos, Chow Mein and the Warer boiled chicken. The Tsos and Mein were decent at best. The other dish which was recommended as their favorite and is supposed to be spicy came out and it was god awful. It was Water boiled spicy beef. We told the waitress it was unedible. It was barely spicy and had something in it that numbs your tongue and tasted like novacane. Our tongues were all numb. No Offer to exchange it for something else. And certainly they were not about to remove it from the tab. Bad customer service as far as I'm concerned. Tip for the owners this is America, not China. Work on your customer service skills
52NCYuD3zFoCsm1HiCBVTw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Went with an open mind to try something new and out of the ordinary. Ordered pig intestine stirfry but server talked me into boiled beef and fish. What a mistake! Flavor was different but initially good. After a few mouths full I began to have a numbness in my lips and tongue. I left and was still charged for inedible food. My suggestion is to go to Panda Express. Terrible food and service to match.
e8p8qRdKReR58upmLfyeQA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Have been for lunch during the week several times and it was worth putting up with the consistently rude and horrible service for the quick and good and cheap food. Went today for early Sunday dinner and will not go back. Service was beyond horrible and food just OK at best. Also too expensive for what you get. I don't need to spend thirty dollars to be treated.rude.
Vzkc7nBkmLBl0vlY21ncqw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not only did they serve us EXTREMELY salty food - for all three dishes and one EXTREMELY SOUR- we had three people in our party, so it's not just my opinion- when we told them to try it, they said it suits out taste and refused to cancel the charge until after thirty minutes of disputing with them. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. (Btw Chinese people at our table so they actually know what it's supposed to taste like)
xFFz7hiCOv5EJFteuLZGTQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Very disappointed! Ordered delivery, food was cold and bland. Worst general TSO chicken ever tasted.
NzAwTtvn0pmD6A33k92cTw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I tried to order to go from this place. The phone rang and rang and rang, when someone finally did pick up they put me on hold until the line disconnected. I called back and had the exact same thing happen. We figured they were just busy and decided to drive there to get to go. There was only ONE car in the parking lot. And the place looked like a total dump, like cockroaches in the kitchen dump. Forget this place. There is no excuse for not taking a phone order when there is no one in your restaurant.
HbF_4udm11EG5TTWsQqWvw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This is a must read! Ok, food was actually good, but one star for one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had. I read all the yelp reviews and wanted to give this place a chance, so I did and won't do it again. Please, please, please don't go here. I called in an order to pick up, the guy couldn't understand me and said 5-7 minutes. Drove over there, clarified my order (which he had wrong) and waited. Apparently they were short staffed so the "waitress" was doing a delivery. After waiting 10-15 more minutes I gave him a credit card, he said he didn't know how to work the machine, so I patiently waited for the "waitress" aka delivery lady to come back. This is where it gets good, she charges me a wrong amount, less, but I didn't notice and just wanted to get out of there. So I generously tip them out of guilt and then get a call from them asking for my credit card because she didn't charge me for everything. I explained I wasn't driving back there, she asked for my CC over the phone and refused. I felt their service was horrible and it was their mistake. Had I not wasted 20+ minutes there (as my food got cold) I would have not been so stubborn. Bottom line- don't do it! Money is too precious to waste on places like this.
Waqj1J-c-d8vqCbFkjjMQA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	OMG!!! this place is horrible do not ever i repeat EVER!!! order from here...reason::: i ordered sesame chicken and pork fried rice i might has well have went to Fry's up the street and got it frozen and cooked it myself really Canton the economy is bad but C'mon now you can atleast import it from china
AZsmaAZcPeFUGnnkuzCmrg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	What is the hubub over China Chili?!?! Don't understand the high rating this restaurant is getting?!? I had not been back to this area for 5+ years and wanted to stay near downtown Phoenix where my friend lives. I looked up high-rated Chinese restaurants in downtown Phoenix and China Chili, of course, came out on top. Well folks, you yelpers here are totally fooled! First of all when you sit down, the menu gives the impression that this restaurant is a Szechaun or Hunan restaurant. It's NOT! The chefs at this restaurant are Cantonese serving Szechaun and Hunan dishes. For starters, my friend and I ordered Sizzling Rice Soup. As entrees, we ordered Szechaun Shrimp and Braised Tofu with Beef. I had a hint of what was to come by listening to the waitresses... Surprise! They all were speaking in Cantonese! The Sizzling Rice Soup was very good. The Szechaun Shrimp turned out to be a Sweet and Sour dish... Shocking! There are almost NO dishes in Szechaun cooking that are Sweet and Sour! It looked nice though, the shrimp was ringed around the plate by thin slices of cucumber. The Braised Tofu with Beef was almost as bad, chemically tenderized beef that probably is used from another dish and dropped in the Braised Tofu. Both dishes were supposed to be HOT... NOT! The only redeeming thing we got out of this adventure was that our wallets were not affected that much by the experience! Demographics of Customers @ 6pm - less than 5% Oriental, 40% of capacity. If you want an authentic Szechaun restaurant, travel down to Tempe to Wong's Place on Baseline Road off of I-60. I will be going there tomorrow night and writing a review which will be more positive than this one!
q6newMFcOfd-12OxxSgLyw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	If i could give China Chili less than one star, I would. Friends keep dragging me there because it is walking distance from their offices. If they keep insisting on China Chili, i might have to show up too late to get lunch. I have never had a good meal there. The worst was mushu that tasted like the vegetables in it were canned.
CV_qXjV40NwWyCRspW8Weg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	They do not use fresh ingredients, or at least they cook so badly to make it seem that way. People must have to convince themselves that this place is good because it's the trendy thing to do. But you're better off going elsewhere if you want good Chinese food. Here's a general tip for you guys: if the place isn't predominantly Asian, leave. That's a definite sign that the quality is sub-par. But if you're white and have never had genuine southern Chinese food, you'll probably just barely choke down your "food" and agree with most people that this place is decent.
HiqoMER97hnLdKYeuaogAw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This place has the oiliest food I've ever eaten in my life. I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil. I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach. I wish I could've washed the other dish too (but it wasn't one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish). Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too. Really not sure what the fuss is about.
4lwcnsP5YjW-qPdGuYlWsA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Some girl I know said she went to China Chili and it was the best Chinese food she's ever had. After she told me that I went to China Chili the next day. The menu is standard for a Chinese restaurant nothing special. We ordered some beef dish for our meal and a side of chow mein. The beef was chewy and the chow mein was bland. I do not understand why people love China Chili. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy!
aIAC-OEnh-i6fIr6NPIgJw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I was really craving chinese food today... too bad this place was NOT what I had hoped for. I ordered the orange chicken, fried rice, soup, and crab puffs. The chicken is dry and tasteless (on the menu it said SPICY however it is not spicy or flavorful at all). The rice has no vegetables or anything - it is just flavorless, oil soaked grains. The soup container was LESS THAN HALF FULL and smelled so wretched I couldn't bring myself to taste it. The crab puffs were decent, but not enough to make up for the 15 dollars worth of wasted food. I won't be coming back.
w1UxuOtjiGDa3MyqWEkwTw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	awful, food was not good, people with me got sick and will not go there again.
5iDVji_zjl8VYZfgb0N5-A	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Seriously, people giving this place high reviews? When we went here last, the chicken was dry and had a burnt coating that slid right off. And it was somewhat temperate in the middle, confirming my suspicion that this was made earlier and then just re-fried, cut, and served. I don't think any restaurant should get any stars when they just open a can or packet (yes, I'm talking about the vegetables and sauces) and mix with pre-cooked meat. That IS NOT good Chinese food. As someone who has lived where there are actual Chinatowns (Boston and San Francisco), I know what very good Chinese food is, and this place certainly is not. Oh, and the lighting. Who said that bright, overhead lighting creates a pleasant atmosphere for dining? I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant here in the Phoenix area that actually puts together fresh ingredients from scratch. If anyone knows of one, please let me know.
eXOfI3HeIpDvpUoIBVOsxA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I have been a regular at China Chili for over 10 years. Sadly once they moved to the new location on 3rd Street and Flower their quality has been deteriorating. Went recently for lunch and ordered the Mongolian Beef and Beef Foo Young and both were awful, no taste, no flavor and very sub standard. The prices have gone up the quality is shameful. I think that the Orange Chicken is possibly their best item right now but sadly did not have it. Thought I would explore to other dishes but never again. Not sure I will be back, possibly for lunch for the Orange Chicken. With so many other choices of Asian Food.. this local favorite has not kept up its quality.
ZGlZ8OJn7n04gZqjupD0LA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	My first review of China Chili was 4 stars. After today's experience I am down to 1 star. I had Kung Pao Chicken and my wife had Lemon Chicken. I like it spicey but this was just sour. I had to leave it. My wife enjoyed her Lemon Chicken but 1 1/2 hours later became sick to her stomach. I wonder if anyone else had a similar experience there today. We have been there several times and were always pleased with everything. This was the first time we had this type of experience. Service was good, food was not.
e3T_oycf_jPuAhn9-ZK24A	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	NASTY! I have lived in Phoenix now for 7 years and have been searching and searching for an up to standard Chinese food restaurant (specifically Sesame Chicken)... and thought I would give this place a try after reading the reviews. Another disappointment. The lunch menu is tiny, they didn't even know what Sesame chicken was and my food came out in literally 1 minute which makes me think they have a vat of it sitting in the kitchen pre-made. My mom ordered the sweet & sour prawns and we were both surprised she could even take a bite to try it... just looked plain nasty. The soup was disgusting and offered no choice besides the "soup of the day" nasty vegetable eggdrop and I have never before see some of the things that were cooked inside the eggroll. Scary. Guessing I will just give up on my search and have to fly into NYC or California for a plate, thank god I am a flight attendant and can do so! Such a disappointment Phoenix Chinese food restaurants are, how is there not ONE good go-to? You Phoenicians have no standards when writing these reviews, I will never yelp another Chinese place and take the locals words for it's rating. Pei-Wei it is, unforunately :-(
oH4727GtAHtzZR4-6MSqIw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I stumbled across this place when I heard 'chile' for the name of this est.. Well, to cut this short; I am a spicy fave type of guy. I didnt experience any 'CHILE let alone some black pepper for my black pepper chicken. Had i wanted some dry chicken calamari imposture whatever it was I wouldve payed for the real thing, this est. upset me and I threw it, what they tried to feed me, in the trash. THIS PLACE WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. Even if they dared try to redeem what happened.
6wUozWJYPpn2cCWm9BVgWA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	A bummer. We had dined at China Chili for several years, but the last experience was a disaster. On Saturday March 15th, my wife and I had dishes we'd loved before, such as chicken with sizzling rice soup and chicken in birds nest (chicken with vegetables with a potato chip like basket). Within hours, I suffered severe symptoms of food poisoning. Without a day my wife did as well. For the next month, I continued to suffer severe gastrointestinal problems, and remain under a doctor's care. My wife was OK after a couple of days, but this was a nightmare. This is direct cause and effect. I've never had such severe problems before, and this was the only meal where my wife and I had the same dishes. I complained to the Maricopa County restaurant examiners, but they weren't interested unless others complained as well. Meantime there is no way I would ever return. I don't need the aggravation.
lZ_1ot1-8IqqUaP1qXZlzQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	If a restaurant wants to be reviewed on more than the quality of its bathroom, its food shouldn't keep the entire party imprisoned there. Despite wonderful service, a good price ($10 for dinner), a lot of premium dishes, and fresh sushi, the overall experience was awful. There weren't any standouts among the dishes- most everything was pretty generic. My whole table took turns rotating through the disgusting bathroom... somehow, we were able to time our vomiting. In retrospect, it's kinda impressive. I think the biggest problem was that the food was kept at room temperature. As others mentioned, the chef spent a lot of time checking on the dishes, but he didn't seem to notice that everything was tepid. The food also ruined the after-dinner movie, which effectively doubled the cost of our loss.
2Pmy0YdmihuqbMfR64i-rQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I shan't be returning. Their festive signage caught me on the way to another venue for lunch, and I thought "why not Chinese?" I'll tell you why; or at least, why not to select this buffet. Being greeted on the way in with a "You are on camera" sign sure is welcoming. I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat. My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice. Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps. But then I got to the food. Nearly everything had the congealed look of having been out too long; the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick. Not exactly appetizing. I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table. The warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm; most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic. I could literally not tell the "orange chicken" from the "sesame chicken" from the "pepper chicken" by any sense other than sight. The rice was room-temperature, but I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me). The fruit selection, which I also sampled, looked fine, but was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm. They have a somewhat vast dessert selection -- particularly for a buffet -- but I'd more than had my fill. Walking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted. There were three more similar signs at the register/gift shop (!). Again, very welcoming. I won't be back, unless I'm told they're under new management.
0JbYrRjDSd6wTvi0zeMJag	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I should have kept driving when we pulled in and there's paramedics with a huge Fire Engine in front of the restaurant with gobs of odd looking people standing around the commotion. I wanted to look at the food before agreeing to sit down and at first glance it looked pretty decent compared to other chinese buffets I've been to. But if I can offer one piece of advice, dont go there on Fridays for lunch....apparently every Friday morning they host the local nut house for a meal. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice gesture but after being in the middle of two pretty intense verbal altercations that quickly turned violent, I knew this was going to be one of those experiences that I would write about on Yelp! There were at least 50 people from the rehab center inside the restaurant trying to get food from the substandard buffet. I should have also noticed something was "up" when I saw all the rehab vans parked in the parking lot. But trying to keep an open mind, we continued to sit down and tried to eat our meal. There were a lot of people shouting at each other and arguing, lots of mentally ill people glaring at us almost in an antagonistic manner. Besides all that, the food was not super hot and was pretty gross and NOT cheap! I would NOT recommend this place for it's food and especially not on Fridays if you don't want to get assaulted by a local mental patient.
4WsKEc6xWalSfuz9LVOUTw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Went by this place last week and it is now closed down.. Looked like they are preparing to raze the building.
VyIjEkM9Rh2fGLX2sFpL_g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Kosher Italian Pizza Restaurants 1_star	Well, I would love to have tried this wonderful food that I read about in the reviews, but I guess I never will. King Solomon's Pizza lost my business on the first try by playing a game I absolutely cannot stand. I ordered my pizza over the phone. I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes, to which I thought was pretty fast. As the gentleman who was taking my order was ready to hang up, I said "Don't you need my name and number?". He replied that it wasn't necessary. That should have clued me in. So, I drive over to pick up my pizza. I walk in and I'm greeted by a couple guys behind the counter. I let them know I'm here to pick up my pizza that I ordered via phone and go on to describe it to them. One guy tells the other what I ordered, conveniently ducks out as the other guy THEN begins to make it. REALLY? So I stop him and tell him why did I order over the phone if they had no intention of making it until I got there? He looks at me and all of a sudden can't seem to understand English and goes back to making the pizza. Nice try JERKS. I tell him to forget it as I will take my business elsewhere. Apparently this is done because they do not trust the customer to show up and pay. This same technique was used on me before a Chinese restaurant in west Phoenix. Fool me once shame on me. Fool me twice, screw you!
7nUbX6J0ckK9mCiXf6aRoA	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Weak. This place is a far cry from the Mill Ave. location in Tempe. Gone now. Long Wong's quality is lost on this place. I had pizza and wings and my slice was literally microwaved to heat it up after I ordered. Bad, bad, bad. Wings have always been decent, but there's really no reason to go there ever again.
iu0Bd9RcCjV0bIKmT6Aj4A	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	A far cry from the South Scottsdale location. The wings I ordered were ice cold! when I brought them back to the counter, the lady said nothing and threw them into a microwave. I kid you not! If you want good wings, try another location. PROS : I didn't get e-coli.
Z7nRwkBCkRqPTvaNFaTBtw	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I don't know if their food is good and frankly, I don't care. All I know is that I have NEVER in my life been so appalled at the horrible level of customer service at this location and I'll never go back. I called in my order one night and was told it would be 15 minutes. When I got there (20 minutes later) my order wasn't ready. I waited an extra 15 minutes before asking how long it would be. When the cashier turned around to find our how much longer, the ex-con looking a*hole of a fry cook in the back shouted some obscenities at me, called me a liar about how long I had been waiting, and that was pretty much all I needed to hear before demanding a refund and walking out the door. Long Wong's can suck a fatty; personally I wish that nasty eyesore had stayed closed.
NCUBvORFVf_C7muDcd3R2A	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	when you walk in its old school which is cool and the outside is cool but the food was medioca just a bit i would not give the a second shot now a different location maybe...
nO7D-nT_cEaLLBDviqgQIQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	.I ordered the pizza and 2 dozen wings for me and a friend. The wings weren't cooked as I asked....they were very wet rather than extra crispy and they gave only two small plastic cups of ranch, you know the ones I'm taking about, can't even fit the tip of a wing in the cup. After 8 wings the ranch was gone. As for the pizza...it is NOT fresh...I think it's actually a frozen pizza. Was horrible and I couldn't even eat more than one slice...waste of my money. The place is very dirty. The kitchen is falling apart, it makes me gag just looking at it. The dining area is filled with too much junk. It would be better if they take half the junk out of there and rid themselves of those old and unused arcade machines, broken toys and clocks and sun bleached decorations. Dusting is not a priority. If a big gust of wind comes in when someone opens the door you better cover your food. I think the only reason this place is somewhat busy at times is because there really isn't any other place in the immediate area. I also think people go there because it USED to be good.
CHcJXp7g2lXwcP2zuJEaJg	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I ordered a dozen garlic Parmesan wings and a order of fried zucchini. Although they weren't the worst wings I've had, they definitely were no where close to being the best. The wings were cold, probably due to the gallon of wet sauce they were covered in. The zucchini was burnt. I was skeptical pulling into the parking lot because it looked like a carnival. Let me just say it looked the same way inside. The dining room was covered in carnival toys and looked like they haven't dusted in years. They had hand made menus all over the place. We also had a homeless visitor come in to our table and ask for money so he could eat. One word for this place YUK!
WU8TF1gFifRkovsJoMbiAQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	If you could imagine what a restaurant would look like if you gave someone acid and told them to do some interior decorating, I am pretty sure this would be the outcome. The outside includes statues of geese, hippos, buffalo's, and assortment of other creatures. The inside is wall to wall with stuff from Humpty Dumpty to an American flag to totem pole. If only the food compared with this quirky atmosphere... Long Wong's gets one star because the FOOD WAS AWFUL. I ordered boneless chicken wings. They were so hard and inedible that I broke my plastic fork trying to stab one to pick it up. I am not talking a little freezer burn here but am talking hard as a rock. The medium buffalo wing sauce was hot but had no flavor. I also had a hot dog. The bun was super stale and fell apart as I tried to eat the hot dog. The Costco style tables were filthy. My child's high chair table is cleaner after she eats than the table we sat at. If you bring your own food and table, you can enjoy the atmosphere. Otherwise, I highly don't recommend.
MNDxjURlqbJtTeCrKR3e-Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	My husband and I are new to Phoenix and have decided to try as many local places as possible. Intrigued by the outside decor, we ventured into this odd place. We ordered 2 meals and sat at a greasy, dirty table. Our wings and burger arrived and we were thoroughly disappointed. The wings (some spicy ranch and some garlic Parmesan) were soggy from the grease and extra chewy. The burger appeared to have been put in the fryer with the wings. The bun was soggy and the patty doused in pepper. They did try to make their greasy food healthier by handing out sandwich bags with carrots and ranch. Good effort. The one star it gets is for decor and fries. The fries are great, just covered in salt (shake then it off and they will be fine.) The decor will keep you entertained and avoid awkward silences.
yEz3NHOYRd-ChnffVNtlGg	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This would be the ideal stop if you were on a scavenger hunt because any and all pop culture trash has been stuck on the wall, shelf or is hanging from the ceiling or parked outside. OMG, hoarder heaven. The food was okay yet i ate very skeptically half expecting a cockroach to climb onto the table. I actually liked the hamburger. There were wings too but i'm not a fan of those - soaked in enough sauce i'll eat though. There are skinny carrot sticks with thin and runny buttermilk dressing for dip on the side of each wing order. There were families at the next table with a whiny child and dad yelling at her for most of our meal - how annoying was that. It appeared there was only one restroom for everyone and we chose not to go there to wash our hands of all the wing grease and sauce.
N_wa_xqYf7993FKBBC3wVg	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Wings were old and dry and gross. Burger was burnt to a crispy and loaded with beyond old lettuce.They forgot the zucchini and mushrooms but im sure they would have been equally gross like everything else. This place is disgusting. If you wouldn't eat this food yourself then don't serve it to your customers.
na3M7mM3J4b3tCb29a9iUg	Phoenix_AZ AZ American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	"If I could rate this place 0 stars I would" I have been to the Long Wongs in Tempe, so my boyfriend and I thought of stopping by here, we wanted to watch the championship game and we needed a place quick. We go in wanting some drinks, well the bar was closed...fine, we went and sat at a table a couple feet from a tv, perfect! We asked what draft beers they had and she said they had Bud Light, Coors Light, and Budweiser, so my boyfriend ordered a coors and i got vodka cranberry, she brought over a bottle of coors light and I walked over to the bar and looked at their tap handles and they also had Shocktop and Sierra Nevada on tap as well. Servers clearly do not know what they even have here. After waiting for about 30 minutes for our appetizer, we finally got it and then 10 minutes later we got our two burgers. We had no napkins and when we were looking for our server who seemed to be non-existent all night we saw her talking with the manager behind a wall, after staring at them for a few minutes he finally noticed and sent her to come check on us for the first time the whole meal. Over all just awful service, our server did not know about food or drinks and on top of it could barely communicate with us. We were there to watch a game along with two other tables of five guys each who were clearly watching the championship and cheering loudly. After about 15 minutes while trying to figure out why I could barely hear the game I realized they had TV on a news channel right behind the counter, and the server & manager were also playing music from a jukebox on the other side of the restaurant in the "closed" bar so loudly I couldn't make out any distinct audio and once we asked why there was music playing she replied "oh we're listening to music." My boyfriend and I both have been working in the industry for years and we are completely understandable of a busy restaurant and things taking a few minutes. There were TWO other tables in there and our server was seen 2 times, our food took forever, and the burgers were not worth it at all. We finally got the check and payed and left, we wrote a small note about how the service was awful (we wanted to talk to the manager but he was too busy trying to get it in clearly) and this is where it gets so much better. We left and saw him walk outside, but we were already on the main street so we called and told him about the situation, he asked us "Yes, was there a problem?" We told him about everything, the service, her not being knowledgable of any of her surroundings or her menu, and he replied "oh...okay" This place is a disaster, they clearly need to make some decisions to get this place turned around or need a complete new management staff, they lost potential regulars and I will tell every single person I can how awful of an experience I had. DO NOT GO HERE!!!
Z6IdwdeSrxy62bcUCJgyCw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Bakeries Food 1_star	I've decided to try this place since I've been going to Arai Pastry in Tempe for a while and wanted to try something new. There were many selections but honestly, I'm gonna stick with Arai Pastry from now on...here is why: *First of all, this is not a Japanese bakery - I'm making this clear because even though there are similarities, Japanese and Chinese baked goods are most of the time, different. *Less than so so decor - It is understood that the decor of the store has nothing to do with the quality of the baked goods. However, since I already know a place that is much cleaner, cuter and with polite service, I can't help but to see it as a negative. *So so service - There were no labels on each pastry trays so I asked the store lady to tell me what was inside some of them. All I saw was annoyance from her....maybe she was just in bad mood....I have no idea. *I tried the following: -French horn - if you want a good one, please try the one at Lee's Sandwich -Custard cream bread - honestly, after a bite, we had to through it away...if you like custard cream bread, try the one at Arai Pastry
qQa9zauNCqWWnkmCtVrbrw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Food Desserts American_(Traditional) American_(New) Restaurants 1_star	I was having lunch today with two business executives. I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad which seemed simple enough. When it was served I began to eat it and noticed there was no chicken. I politely asked if I had ordered wrong and she said "no" the chicken might be on the bottom. I checked, no chicken. I again brought it to her attention and she said she had to show the kitchen to be sure that I was correct. She then proceeds to take my salad that I had been tossing around to the kitchen . They go through it and she brings the same salad back saying "yea, you were right they forgot it, they laughed and added some for you". I would have thought they would have made a new one not played with mine and add chicken to fix it. I chose not to eat it after others have handled it. I didn't want take it further because I was with others. But.... Cheesecake, I was embarrassed enough for us all. Worst service ever! And an attitude I was shocked by! I sure the other people I was with will not return there anytime soon. There are a lot of great places to go at the Biltmore and Cheesecake if no longer one of our choices.
8gn4efrR8GV5ccYQijGyNg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Sushi_Bars Japanese Restaurants 1_star	Let me preface this review with the fact that I'm Chinese and I know my rice. So after a meeting next door @ Hava Jave (review for that place to follow) a friend and I wandered over to Zen32 for a 10pm snack. Boy was that a mistake. I normally eat up at Celsius in Desert Ridge so I thought I'd get the same food down here to compare. A couple of the rolls we ordered: Viva Vegas Roll Caterpillar Roll The service was just fine but honestly, even if I had Angelina Jolie serving the food naked, the food would still be crap and the rating would still be an UNO star. The rice seemed like it was day-old rice. It was clumpy and honestly, I don't know how a sushi chef takes CLUMPY rice and puts it into a roll... so anyway, due to the clumpiness of the rice, the Vegas roll was loosly rolled so it fell apart when I tried to pick it up. The Caterpillar roll tasted super bland which is VERY hard to do because it includes so many different ingredients like eel, faux crab, avocado, cucumber, and eel sauce. Not only did it taste bland, it was also poorly rolled. Again, the service was nice but you might want to bring your own sushi if you're going to eat here...
6YS2bb4Xl6AYU2MI98mEzQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Sushi_Bars Japanese Restaurants 1_star	I should have went to the Safeway next door for sushi. This was the first time I went to sushi joint, looked at the menu and decided that the best sounding thing was the steak. I opted for the grilled salmon and wasabi mash. While I am a huge sushi fan, the price of the rolls were a wee bit more expensive than some GOOD sushi places I went to. My friend opted for a bento box that had a crab nigiri (which was simply a half a stick of imitation Krab on top of rice). So sad. My plate arrived and looked like a garden threw up on my plate. The steamed veggies were scattered around my plate like the salad shooter malfunctioned. The grilled salmon was just okay, served on top of wasabi mash that was also just okay. The server was also very clueless. She brought over a bowl of miso soup and sat the soup between my friend and I. I wasn't sure who it belonged to so I asked for straws so we could share. =) She didn't think it was too funny. She said she wasn't sure whose meal it came with so she just left in the middle so we can figure it out. (THANKS!) By the way, the waitresses were wearing traditional Chinese dresses. Shouldn't they be in a kimono or something? Who is the smart white guy that owns this place?! I walked away from Zen 32 and I won't be back.
OaUG_V8QBbisUx5K8ufrIg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Sushi_Bars Japanese Restaurants 1_star	I don't think there's much to Zen 32 besides looking trendy. Something seemed strange about the place when I walked in, and after reading other reviews it's been pointed out--the waitresses are wearing Chinese attire with Mandarin collars. I won't hold the lack of authenticity against them. Also, the music is soft and the seating kind of cramped, making for an awkward dining experience. I'll get the good thing out of the way--the reverse happy hour. The hot ginger sake was overpowering, but for $1 there's no way I can complain. Also, they had a few basic rolls for $3, and that's not too bad. Everything else sucks! The specialty rolls are all stuffed with krab, so what hope do you have of ever getting quality sushi? My tootsie roll was garbage, I couldn't taste anything beside the krab inside. The caterpillar roll looked nice, but I could only taste krab and eel sauce. Even the rainbow roll looked promising, and THAT was drenched in sriracha. I also had some of this teriyaki chicken entree, and it was rough and a bit dry. The edamame had way too much salt, and I began noticing a pattern to this place. Take crap and season it as much as you can. I'd like to give this place a second chance for a cheap date or something, but I'm still a little angry at this place (and their sketchy waitress!), for being the first to make me tired of sushi. A friend bought me this meal and I still regret it. It's that bad.
8kXCFxUzW55DLh_qWQrgXA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	God this place is awful!! Did it change hands between 1/19/09 when Matthew K. was there & 1/27/09 when I was there?¿? The sign on the side of the building says "OPEN EAT" ...Straight forward & direct! I liked that, so I tried it. Inside & out, the place looks very old. I would guess 1940s. It's medium in size, & there were about 25 trays of food out. There were only about 5 other customers in the place on a weekday at 12:30, which was my first warning sign. The second was the egg flower soup. It was gooey & blah (1940's style, I wondered?). The food table was against the wall, so you have to reach far for the items that are in the back. The ranch dressing was runny, & the macaroni salad blah. The unfriendly Chinese lady brought me some "hot tea", which was lukewarm. Back at the food table, the rest of the food was greasy, not very warm, or both. The whole deal was seriously terrible... the second worst restaurant I have ever eaten at, after Wagon Wheel, Oxnard, CA. (Fortunately that place finally folded & this one needs to as well!) "OPEN EAT somewhere else!"
Da3YXIVZ58fyRJSlPqQ9Xg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Read a review from the newspaper so I tried it. Not impressed. The atmosphere is about as dismal as the food. They need to make it a place people want to come in and eat instead of get out of there as soon as possible. Gross!
Q3XuuPZ2QbyLL34TIT3YUA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	..my original review was deleted due to violating Yelp's Content Guidelines or Terms of Services. Not sure how, or why. I think you all should know how bad the food was here, and how dirty the establishment was inside before you waste the trip. I also made a point to note that being of a specific ethnic origin does not automatically grant you a superior palate which can taste food from that origin better than the next person. Bottom line: The kitchen was a disgusting wreck when I was able to peek back in there. The food gave me food poisoning, and was hands down the worst I've had. It is hard for me to respect a business who doesn't respect their customers enough to sweep the floor-
DpwAb1-Iqsh0RRBIUVwmaw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	we ordered three entrees for delivery. it took about forty five minutes and then the delivery guy proceeded to argue with my boyfriend over how much he should tip him. after finally handing over the greasy box with our food in it, we were disgusted to see some form of batter and seeds that should have been my sesame chicken. it was ominously labeled "HCl." the food was disgusting and I can't believe how rude the delivery guy was. we paid 35 dollars for nothing but disappointment. buyer beware. we certainly won't be back here.
mx2ACeUrj-4DiOW5WWDPVg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This location was a joke...me and my girlfriend went here while we were waiting for her cars oil to be changed at the brake Masters down the street. You stand in line like at a cafeteria and the people behind the counter dishing out your not so fresh food can barely speak English, the tray I picked up was sticky and dirty and had some type of half dried syrup on it and it was disgusting. They served us and did not even give us silverware, or chopsticks to eat with, and the general decor of this restaurant looks like a ghetto Chinese buffet in crack central. The floors and restaurant in general were D.I.R.T.Y. like Christina Aguilara dirty back in the day before she was a mom!!!! The food tasted like it had been sitting in a pan for 3 hours, and I would NEVER go to this place again, I was surprised I didn't find a finger or a needle or a cockroach in my plate of mushroom chicken with vegetables.

n_yxY28QGxJF0bydb_1dVw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I've never experienced this before, but I'm just going to let you be the judge: I am starting to watch/count my calorie load, especially when I am eating out. American Chinese is famous for huge calorie loads in the sauces and fried treatments, so I thought I would split the middle and order a brown steamed rice with broccoli and beef. Well, I asked the young lady behind the counter for the calorie count chart and she quickly said she would have to ask someone. No problem and expected...but what happened next was not: She walked to the back of the galley-style kitchen past the viewing, walkin freezer to find her manager. Outside of the freezer is the prep area with a large gray garbage can. She stood there, asking her question, HOLDING THE GARBAGE CAN. Then she and the manager walked back to me. The manager came with the paper and placed it on the prep line. And she grabbed a bowl to serve me. WAAAAAAIT! "Uh, excise me. Is that a garbage can?" I asked. She looked back and asked where. "There...in front of the freezer...the big gray thing with the black garbage bag stretched around the rim." "Yes". I asked her if she realized that she stood there and grabbed the rim and talked to her manager. "No," she replied. "My dear, I watched you and you not only grabbed the garbage can you just came and grabbed my bowl to serve me." She put the bowl down and walked away, washed her hands and apologized. Needless to say, I won't be coming back.
g2vA_wj3x1Dp4Puw3Z_GQA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I consider myself a good fan of Panda Express, but at this location in not going again, I order like always my regular rice with teriyaki chicken n cream cheese, but this time, the chicken wasn't ready so they told me I had to wait n that was fine for me I wasn't on a hurry, but I guess they tough I didn't want to wait, by the time I started eating I find out my chicken wasn't good it was acceptable but far away from the regular quality I can expect from them, but to make worst my rice didn't had any trace of salt. I went to the counter n I let the lady know about my findings, but she tried n said "you're right Sir. it's unsalted but that's the way it is." I definitely didn't expect that answer, my meal cost me around $8 n I was really hungry, so I didn't want the situation to escalate for that amount, but for sure my last visit to this location...
c7lAvksYKOUjg8UDNvA7gQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Went for lunch and was very disappointed. Restaurant smells musty and the food was awful. Service was very good.
_hmHA8gX2TwoXX4SA-bEDA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I had one hour for lunch, and had heard this was one of the best places in town. I expected the lunch combo would come with a cup of soup - but not here, even though lunch is hi-priced. The weather was cold, so I wanted soup. I ordered sizzling rice soup and some egg rolls. It took 45 minutes between the time I sat down and when I got my food! The soup was not sizzling, and had small round BURNT rice cakes floating in the cup. BURNT BLACK. I had ten minutes to eat and get back to the office, so I could not return my meal. I fished out the burnt pieces and ate quickly. Maybe this place had a good rep in the past, but I will never go back there!
XbMiiI8l7fNoRPeVamK7ZQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	WORST FOOD EVER!! I went there for their lunch specials and got the sweet and sour chicken. The egg roll was great, but the sweet and sour chicken was horrible. The sauce had no flavor and ruined my entire dish. Depending on your liking, the there were very thick peices of chicken within the dish with very little breading. I personal enjoy breading with my sweet and sour chicken.
OsEWbKYosJ_xX9f0kykT6g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	My mom and I recently started on a quest for the best po po platter in Phoenix. So naturally we ended up here. With the amazing reviews and extremely high prices I was ready to be impressed. I was not. In fact, this was what my mom called "the worst American Chinese food I've had in my life". The food was bland and greasy, to the point where we felt so bad that we took the majority of our overpriced entrees to our house just to throw it out. The po po platter (which they called a Bo Bo platter?) was dry and the plum sauce accompanying it was watery. My sweet and sour chicken, was tough and cold. The meat, not covered in what would be a sweet red sauce, was snow White. My mothers 'Desert Jade Shrimp' was, as she said, "only covered in butter". The only two good things in this restaurant was the Mai Tais and the service. I was appalled by this meal. It was not worth the trip.
K4uNClc-QW1oGhSS_HAW-g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I cannot in good faith recommend this restaurant. This is definitely the low end of Chinese food for Phoenix. Normally I'd try a place more than once, but, in this case... Not going to happen.
7_uIV4vYzEBlvdwndDlbTg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Worst. Buffet. Ever. 'Nuff said. No...scratch that, I must vent. Or Yelp. Wow, what a disaster. My workmate and I were craving a buffet today, and on the way into work I had passed the Golden Coin and thought it looked like any standard cheap buffet from the outside. But I was fooled, it's not just ANY cheap buffet, it's THE cheap buffet. Well, as Roger Daltrey says, "I won't get fooled again!" The sign outside says $4.86 buffet, lunch or dinner. For less than a Lincoln, it's worth a try, right? (Wrong!) First of all, cash only, people, no plastic. And here's the ENTIRE buffet list: Rice (of the brown fried variety, bland) Lo Mein (I'm not sure what that taste is, but it ain't Lo Mein) Egg Rolls (small, cut in half, and awful. And there's that "taste" again...) Fried Chicken (the only food of redeeming quality) Wings (again, bland, though decent in size) Sweet and Sour Pork (I'll get to this in a second) Yep, that's it. The whole buffet. And no refills on the sodas, either. Some greasy chinese crispy noodles. No soup. (Hey, no soup means not having to provide spoons!) The fried chicken wasn't bad, but other than that, I wouldn't serve this food to prisoners. Except the ones on death row, and that's to save money on electricity. I'm not quite sure what the deal was with the Sweet and Sour Pork. The sauce was the consistency of water, the meat was......wait, I don't want to know. If I could give it 1/1000th of a star, I'd do it. Steer clear, and your digestive system will thank you.
fsZcAJ0iL6aFhCt9leIKpQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Let's be fair to Mike Kwan here & make it clear that this is NOT the worst buffet in Phoenix, much less the world. For that, you'd have to decide between Hong Kong Restaurant & New Sun Star Super Buffet at Central & Southern! The problem here isn't that the food is bad, it's that they don't have anything! It's a tiny place with just a few hot food choices for $4.86. Now, I'm not going to complain about the price, but I want salad, so that was it for this place... won't see you there! If you want "cheap", whip over to Best Wok Buffet at McDowell & 51st Ave. instead. It's much better, & it's only $4.25 for lunch, & $4.95 for dinner!
ssBbK7KaiMC5SGjhdnzR-w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	For some reason my parents loved the Golden Coin chain when I was a child, and this seems to be the only one left standing. Maybe it was better back then, I don't really know. First of all, I hate buffets with a fiery passion, but this is by far the worst one I've ever had the displeasure of being dragged to. The ambience of the restaurant makes you feel as if you're eating your last meal in prison before being sent off to the chair. The food was gross and the food options were miniscule. I only had a few bites because I didn't like it and I was worried I'd get sick, if you ever visit this dive trust me, you'll feel the same way. The booths are also extremely uncomfortable and the restaurant is tiny and crammed. Bottom line, they should have just let this buffet chain die.
QIWAFitct9mUBRzglVfIQg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Walked in the other day. Looked at the dashboard size buffet of 8 maybe 10 items. One of those being fried chicken, which is probably better done across the street. Walked back out and will never return. The place is a rat hole! The building should be condemned.
VPzVsGpJzQgzF9u0m-fTwg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	this place sucked u walk in cash only had to go to chevron and pull money out biggest mistake i should have stayed out so its $6.95 with a drink and you have to get ice tea to get refills all the good ones u have to pay (not that the others were any better) another $1.40 (retarded) the selection is 4 or 5 dishes which include chicken, fried rice, fried noodles, small freaken veggie egg rolls and some pepper chicken (WTF) seat selection is not bad but you see drunk indians go behind the gas station not to mention if you need the restroom its a door that goes outside to another door smh this is NOT place you wanna go sorry but i will never return
iateG1uPJf1n0jsxzrzU8w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Buffets Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Wish I was able to give 1/2 of a Star! I don't know why the Yelper in me failed to check out Golden Coin prior to giving it a shot. However, I craved an all you can eat Chinese Buffet and went to Golden Coin because it was close to work. Probably the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to, I take that back "No Probably" about it, Golden Coin is the worst Chinese Buffet I have ever been to! Eight Items on the Buffet Fried Wontons, Rice, Lo Mien, Vegetables, Chicken, Chicken Wings, Egg Rolls, & Sweet and Sour pork As I took my first bite of rice a single thought ran through my head: "How can a Chinese Restaurant not cook rice right"? If the rice wasn't bad enough the Lo Mien sure was, not sure how to describe that taste, but it's not Lo Mien, so I will stick with tasteless soggy noddles. The eggrolls were equally bad, small, cut in half, and horrible and once again a taste that is hard to describe, so lets go with tasteless again, after all it worked when describing the Lo Mien. Moving on to the sweet and sour pork, this dish consisted of small,dried out, hard pieces of what I am assuming was pork covered in a reddish sauce that had the consistency of water. Tasteless doesn't begin to describe that dish! The Wontons can best be described as greasy crispy noddles and don't even get me started on the chicken and wings. How in the world does Golden Coin prepare that stuff? It's awful. So there yo have it, that's it. The entire Golden Coin Buffet. Don't think you can wash down a bad meal with soda....no refills on the sodas at Golden Coin!!!!
vo3B3rvGQiLLoxtTwAm2pw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Thai Restaurants 1_star	Me want to likey likey but no can do. I'm disappointed in this place and the 4-star rating it got. How misleading. I should have known this place was no good when I didn't see a single Thai person in the joint. Don't tell me they were all in the back cooking either. Its like walking into a Mexican restaurant and all the wait staff were Chinese. Well... now its sounding like ChinoBandito. Anway--- I digress. I came in for lunch and the menu was expansive! I've never seen so many words that begin with K. I wanted to try something different than my regular pad thai, curry, tom yum but I couldn't decide and went off something from their lunch menu. I think it was Thai bbq chicken with spicy sauce. I figured, I can't go wrong with that. Not traditional Thai but I couldn't make up my mind about the others. Well, they ran out. I wasn't sure if they ran out of Thai bbq or chicken. Apparently its bbq so I settled for the sesame chicken. Bad idea. When in Thai- I should probably order Thai... but... um.. how do you screw up sesame chicken? The Panda Express has mastered it! Now you! It will be a while before I try this place out again but I just didn't expect them to not be able to cook. I will start at a one-star for now and promise to order an authentic dish next time so I can be a better judge. I did have the thai milk tea and that was good. So one-star for good tea!
xcJlgmC5Ugi8T2rzY0n1kw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Thai Restaurants 1_star	This restaurant is mediocre Chinese type at best... Ordered the green curry and a red curry... The green curry was a lumpy, floating in grease mess. The red was equally as greasy and neither had coconut milk in them?? I can't believe this place is still in business. We did call as soon as the containers were opened to ask exactly WTH they were, and they were quick to offer a refund to our card (something tells me they get many similar calls)... Not authentic thai by far.
2mT-uMg3VMoyZx2Zn34crQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Thai Restaurants 1_star	Is the food here Thai or Chinese?? Where is the basil, an important ingredient in Thai cuisine, in their dishes?? And the fish sauce, another crucial ingredient that marks Thai flavors?? This could pass for Americanized Chinese food though but I'll pass on this place next time...

FkuW15QCGZPM3R8O09o26g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Gluten-Free Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I don't consider myself a connoisseur of Asian cuisine, especially streamlined Asian-American cuisine that's one step above fast food, but I will say this. The caramel chicken takeout dish comes with a separate small container for the vegetable slaw that goes on top. There is absolutely no excuse for a piece of broken eggshell the size of a thumbnail finding its way into the slaw container. Not to mention there was raw egg goop still attached to it. This has been one of several issues I've recently had with this location's food and service. The previous two times, the pad thai I ordered contained NO tofu whatsoever, when I know that's part of the Pei Wei pad thai recipe, having ordered the exact same dish at other, more competent locations. As if to add insult to injury, when I called and spoke to the manager about the aforementioned eggshell incident, he claimed over the phone that he would refund what I paid for that meal and that the money would go back onto my credit card. Guess what never happened. And... Guess who's never going back to this sucktastic poophole ever again. Thanks a lot for your disgusting food preparation and deceitful management. If someone from Pei Wei company corporate is reading this, please do yourself and your customers a favor and FIRE the manager running this joint.
ozgFXM8rHrVgcAdzCaSC5g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Gluten-Free Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Compared to other Pei Wei locations across the valley, this location is by far the worst. I've gotten takeout for lunch about five times, and each time has been worse than the last. Even after two of my coworkers ended up with violent food poisoning after eating the food here, it took finding an EGGSHELL with bits of raw egg in my Caramel Chicken to realize that something was seriously wrong with this joint. Not only was the food extraordinarily disgusting, as an added bonus, it contains pieces of kitchen garbage. When I called the manager to complain, he offered me a refund to my credit card over the phone, which never actually happened. Thanks for the lies. Thanks for the disgusting food. And thanks for asking Yelp to take down my previous review.
iK6ZVzRL_DqSnU_h-D66-A	Phoenix_AZ AZ Gluten-Free Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I used to like Pei Wei but something about their meat tastes different. It does not taste right. I tried it a few more times but haven't been back since and will definitely steer clear. I told a manager right away and he made a new plate, but the new meat tasted just as strange. I told him and the sweet fellow apologized although it was out of his control. I hope this is not another case of quality suffering because of quantity. Is it easier to buy from sloppy, poorly regulated slaughter houses and inject meat pieces with filler - creating a mystery meat that the masses will most likely still enjoy as long as there's a distracting sauce or glaze?

It was the worst chinese food I have ever eaten. We ordered sesame chix which was soggy and gross. The eggrolls were overpriced and are more like a spring roll. the lomein is okay but will never get food from here again.
ZBXa4I-VVl3yNBDAW-v53g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This place must have an insect infestation. About a month ago my sister ordered take out and found a cricket in her almond chicken. When she called and confronted them about the situation they showed no remorse or shock. The next day she took the food back. What is really disburing about this is that when I shared the story with my best friend she said she had a fly on her plate several years ago. I will never eat here again.
u7pjN89tvWdKmeH4CjfhLw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Ok.. First time I ordered from this place. I wanted to try something new. Sorry I did! Ordered some thing simple, Mongolian beef. I took a few bites and i was disgusted how raw the beef was. I don't mean med rare or rare. I mean raw! It was so unappetizing I just threw it in the trash. I can't find one redeeming quality about what I ate. Don't even get me started on the wife's entree and soup! Yuck! However, the egg roll was good! At least it was cooked! What was delivered to me was not even fit for the stray cat in the front yard! Please... Read this.. I rarely criticize, but this was down right horrible! What a waste of money!
nYQlodrI0X2_xpEwg_5QBA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Ordered the takeout combination special for four. It was awful. The chicken wings were raw, not just under cooked. We stopped to alert the management. They refused to reverse the charges even though we dropped off their food to show them. The ridiculous reply was. "You bit into the wings, so no refund." Although we order take-out 3 to 4 times a week, we will never go back.
MWKE87pzCeXNrwhG6T1AZA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Since I was 8 years old I have been coming here. I am 24 now. That's sixteen years as a customer. We order about 4 times a year for the past few years. Let me detail some changes. Instead of serving their food in the take out boxes many people associate with Chinese they changed this procedure about a year ago. Now they come on cheap plastic plates with a top that can be sealed. Why does this matter? The volume of food you get in these plates is less than what it used to be. So I let that go, I kept ordering. My orders usually end up about 45-50 bucks. Yesterday, I had my worst service and food that I have ever received. I MADE a yelp account because I am so pissed off. The Teriyaki chicken was hard, rock hard. It tasted like 2 day old leftovers. The kind that were left under a lamp. The PuPu Platter which costs 9.50 a piece contained jack sh1t. I ordered TWO of them , that is 19 dollars of Pu Pu Platter and the result I took a picture of because I couldn't believe it. This is what 19 dollars looks like : http://i.imgur.com/TZhEuV5.jpg I called back, and was told this was a normal portion. Lol. I have been going here for years, and they finally lost me as a customer yesterday. I can say for certainty that I will never order from this place again, and neither should you. As an aside I added up 50 an order 5 times a year for 16 years, me and my family have probably spent around 4000 dollars at this one place throughout that time. Bye bye.
a7gZAgugWTfGSHW-hl1WuQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Okay used to be a 5 quickly turned into a 1 star all because of one night my family & I had been screwed over by this place.. If you have a family of 4 or more be prepared to wait wait wait and watch everyone else eat & leave before you even get the sight of food. I really enjoyed getting the hot tea they bring to your table before your meal I didn't even receive that we got one pot for 8 people including children.. two people were served food after 2 hours I honestly question myself why we waited so long waited some more, two people in our family finished their meal and the rest of us were still waiting. Did not even refill water, told the server continuously that other guests were eating and leaving before we even got a plate of something...we decided to leave we expressed our frustration to the "owner" if that's what she even was and we refused to pay for nothing we received, we stormed out of there and she had the nerve to run out and record all of our license plates.. are you flipping kidding me.. no one was kidding when they told us "all they care about is, you got your food right?" The two out of eight people that came to dinner came back to the restaurant asked for them to please throw out the license plate numbers they "sightly" discounted the bill for the two plates & we now vow to never return to this crap hole of a restaurant. I will miss that lemon chicken but im sure there is another restaurant out there that would gladly appreciate our money than this place... oh & I went into labor a few hours after this to top it all off. thanks little shanghai, thanks for sending me into labor....
tpTHx-BovQSJ7g3Iae-Kpw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Gluten-Free Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Had the Korean Lettuce Wraps and an Asian Chicken Salad on 06/02. The lettuce wraps were good but the Asian Chicken Salad had a long hair in it. I sent it back and another salad was given to me without dressing. I thought I was imagining things so I had my friend taste it. He agreed there was no dressing. I got a refund and went to Paradise Bakery down the street. I really like Pei Wei but I will never go back to this location. It seems like they just don't care.
ISGwszwCR_2k_eE0Bfeepw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Before writing this, I had it all planned out in my head. First sentence: "I can't believe I actually went here and am admitting it" but it's obviously a popular spot for yelpers. Crazy. My mom and dad suckered me into meeting them here and it's kind of awful and agreeably Americanized Chinese food. My parents just love this place and think it's the best Chinese in town*. Everything tasted totally "off"... even the fried rice, which quizzically had none of the ingredients I'm used to it having. The water tasted dirty and I saw 2 NASCAR t-shirts while I was here (these set my "check engine" light on immediately). *This both confuses and comforts me... I can finally put to rest dreams of my parents reverting back to their free-wheeling, adventurous, hippie personality types they once graced this world with. They are now Bush-loving Republicans, and I am... okay with this. Breathe, Norma.
rB3yn4IP33zBLqxvf0Rv4w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	awful, food is bad and there is nogood service.
LOyLn2sy3ZWzCtPDA_ueYw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Too bad that my first review on Yelp is a negative one :( . I went to Super Dragon today. I ordered Kung Poa chicken, and I could not eat it. The chicken tasted really really bad, as if they re heated it (the taste of left over chicken), also the rice comes on the side in a pot that you scoop from and it will go to other guests after you finish. well who knows if the guest before you did scoop properly with out making a mess, without coughing, sneezing or even laughing over the rice pot while scooping? I was totally unsatisfied.
BUJirzrkSMI3VRhR5uhnng	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I was traveling from Tucson to Phoenix for training and staying at the Best Western Plus about a mile away. The hotel had advertised this restaurant, the reviews were great and I decided to go there. I went there wanting to just take my food and eat it at the hotel room where I could get comfortable but I can honestly say I took longer deciding what to order than it took for them to actually hand it off to me which makes me question the integrity of how they make their food since I ordered the beef crunchy noodle. The customer service was horrible, no eye contact, no courtesy when speaking directly to the customer, and I know they had the potential for it because there was a woman sitting besides me which she was greeted by a warm, loud hello followed with laughter and a full blown conversation while I was just handed my food followed by a hurried "bye". I get to the hotel and guess what? There was no fork included with my order but luckily the hotel provided me with one. Hoping that the food was going to be as stellar as everyone had posted and have my troubles compensated by the taste of this food... I can say I was sorely disappointed. The beef was chewy, it tasted overcooked, it was just disguising eating it that I just ended up throwing the food away. It was a waste of time, gas, and of $10.29 out of my account but lesson learned. The fortune cookie was tasty though :)
x6U8UtNuEEAmhVxK7MxTCQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Ugh, so slow, and not friendly, they could care less if they have your business, and the food shows it.
0ISKFUcdzjewgMxgGoPD-g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This place has to be some of the worst Chinese food in my life. Seriously, I am wondering if it is some kind of joke. I ordered delivery from this restaurant, the delivery was executed by a courier service, the order took roughly one hour. I ordered vegetarian spring rolls, and a green vegetable stir fry. We are used to seeing spring rolls delivered in what our Asian grocery stores sells as, "spring roll wrappers," made from rice paper. I did not intend to order fried, greasy mess rolls. These were friend in either old oil or oil that was far too hot, they were significantly darkened. Judging by the amount of residual oil, the oil was old and not up to temp. According to the menu description of the green vegetable stir fry, "the name says it all." We'll, that's clearly a lie because the name didn't tell me it would be awful. The dish as delivered was a limp pile of bok choy (wouldn't have ordered if it were only bok choy)...seriously...no scallions, onion, carrot, or any other veg besides the bok choy. The veg was limp and gross, topped in bits of garlic with absolutely no flavor. There was a little sauce, I am not sure what it was made from and I am a very serious cook, my guess would be oil, freezer concentrate and some boxed thickener. These were seriously not seasoned at all and my toothpaste packs a better flavor. On the side were fried rice and low mein noodles, it's just slightly weird to get rice AND noodles, both of which were dreadful. The rice was unseasoned and lacked vegetables, the noodles had no hint of flavor and no crispness in the veg that might give it some texture. Nothing was seasoned or flavorful- I poured everything they sent me to try to help it out, this went badly. There was a tempura shrimp and crab Rangoon on the side, I didn't eat it because I am a vegetarian, but they looked and smelled awful, it wouldn't surprise me if someone became ill after eating them. The Rangoon was definitely previously frozen, and the shrimp probably made it from the freezer with no pit stops to the fryer judging by the coating. I literally thought this might have been a joke when my fortune cookie ( generic made by the Kari-Out-Co) lacked fortunes, and I am not making that up. This place definitely needs a health inspection, and probably needs to be closed. I really feel bad if locals eat here, please try Chinese food in coastal California, Houston or northeastern cities because you will easily see the difference. Overall, this was just epically bad. They don't deserve the one star, consider this the yelp equivalent of a participation trophy.
XE85gNOHBsh0s9c8qrLYJQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	HORRIBLE!!!! I ordered Chicken Fried Rice, General Tso's Chicken, Orange Beef and egg rolls. Very poor cuts of meat. Terrible Flavor. Cabbage in egg rolls smelled and tasted rotten. I highly recommend going anywhere else. DO NOT EAT THERE!!!
avC2xhg8bDJRIeCmdncbjw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	The reviews on here are fake and written by the owners... The food here is not good at all and the staff are idiots. Never coming here again... Ever.
AjgPMCJ2F33e-RCPEh0lDw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	The crispy duck was aweful dry and all bones chopped up with little meat. The plum sauce was not helping. And the server argued with me that the crabmeat in the crab sauce was real when it was actually overpriced disgusting canned corn chowder with imitation crab. I should of listened to my fiance when he said this place was horrible. Yuck never again.
EtRSyF0-nPAugICrATzTHA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	We decided to try this placed based on the good reviews here. It was awful. We ordered a few items from the menu for take out and we were truly disappointed. The sauce did not come on the chicken and the chicken was EXTREMELY dry. We couldn't eat any of it. Total waste of money.
orHEGPi6hYrYXMQWA3QWaw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I'm sorry but this place was awful. My boyfriend and I were very hopeful reading the reviews of others before we decided to try it out. First of all, the decor is awful and in desperate need of an update... From the pepto bismol walls to the green booths it's just not good... Food wise, we had the dinner combo of sizzling rice soup, pu pu platter (which tasted just like it sounds), and the flamingo chicken for the entree... It also came with fried rice and some other small shrimp dish which turned into a disgusting gelatinous goo (see uploaded picture)... The chicken had a nasty oily flavor to it like it had been fried too long and just doused in sauce to mask the flavor. The only decent thing we had was the fried rice which the rice was over cooked but ok... Service was mediocre... Our drinks NEVER got refilled and nothing but a sorry when they noticed we didn't eat hardly any of the food. $40 bucks later we left disappointed and disgusted. Never coming here again.
KQ1ZedqOODpEPzp94OpEYg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Our regular Chinese place was closed for the weekend, so my boyfriend, room mate and I tried Flamingo Fallace.. Literally wish I went to sleep for the night instead. First I specifically ordered cream cheese crab puffs and when I noticed I received just regular fried wontons I became annoyed. And after I tried my orange chicken I was less than happy. My boyfriend's chicken fried rice tasted as if it had been sitting for hours.. Definitely not fresh, or remotely close. My roommates sesame chicken tasted & looked the same, awful. When I brought the food back 3 asian women were waiting to confront me, heated more than I was. I started to explain that the food was terrible and i'd like a full refund. One woman became defensive and interrupted me before I could even tell her what was wrong. She would not listen to me because i "didn't even try the rice" as if the old fried rice was about to change my mind on a $45 order of shit. I was appalled with how this woman talked to me and how she tried to make ME feel bad because I didn't like the food. Even after only eating 1/5 of my orange chicken I was sick through out the night and the next morning with diarrhea and nausea. Sorry if it's too much info but I thought I'd be honest and save you the pain and suffering of eating this terrible food. Do yourself a favor and try somewhere else. Noodles & Rice is way cheaper and a million times better. YOU ARE WELCOME!
mfxBVAKaOi2CM7r_QHhnyA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Anyone who rates this 4 stars is an idiot. I probably would have given it 2 stars based on the fact, that they serve the exact same generic Chinese as everyone else. But then add in the "cheap factor". I ordered a ton of food, and your delivery driver (whom I tipped) doesn't even give a single packet of soy sauce!!! Really??? Well on the plus side, I won't throw my money down the toilet with this company again
gBE615yhFfV6MXxAuR86Zg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Mediocre would be the apt word to describe food at Flamingo Palace. I'm baffled as to why this place has glowing reviews. Tried the Twice Cooked Pork, Flamingo Special Chicken, Szechwan Chicken (it's Flamingo Special Chicken with a different sauce) and some Chicken Fried Rice on different occasions, and all four were average -nothing great. In fact, I would get my money's worth at Pei Wei or Panda Express. This place should be avoided at all costs.
tmOJzsuhlGZ_kgnU2rpZNg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Well I tried this place for the 1st time.. and I have to say.. crab puff.. good... dumplings.. good.. eggrolls.. not so good.. $37 take out order including tip NOT WORTH IT.. I couldn't even eat the szechaun shrimp and scallops.. HORRIBLE.. I had 2 bites and I was nervous to eat the rest cause there was a funny taste.. nothing like szechaun I have ever had ever.. no veggies.. just juice and prob 10 shrimp and 6 scallops in a big container of juice. Sooo I guess I will continue to search for a good chinese restaurant in phoenix.
HWB_bRkorzmYtC2ClXexag	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Having just moved into the neighborhood, we ventured to try Bamboo House, hoping to find a close place to get our Chinese fix. Unfortunately, on our visit, B.H. did not live up to the hype. My boyfriend put it very succinctly: "There wasn't anything wrong with the rice." We ordered meat dumplings, orange chicken and garlic chicken. The meat dumplings were no frills, basically barely seasoned meat stuffed into wrappers and then fried. The orange chicken was passable, but nothing special (I think Panda Express does better, and I loathe that place). The garlic chicken was a spicy, sodden mess, barely edible. As if this wasn't disappointing enough, my hot tea was weak, vaguely honey flavored water. His iced tea appeared to be the same tea poured over ice. But, at least the rice was okay, right?
H94EPMMzwxdNcORwzrfnNw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Let's just say this. I feel sorry for you people who thinks this restaurant serves good food. Went there after reading all your fine reviews here. I will be short and sweet. Hot and sour soup was passable, the pad thai was edible. House chicken was big chunks of deep fried breading with salty brown sauce. Mongolian beef was salted jerky with green onions, and the fried rice is just white rice with soy sauce in it. The soda was okay. If you have ever had decent Chinese food,, stay clear. This is not it. Will someone get my money back?
N8euDTtfmX6hfdlaEGxJ5Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	JUST say no.. the worst General Tsos chicken I have ever tasted.. its supposed to be spicy.. not so sugary.. and seriously I was ill that night.. my friend had sweet and sour...and it was sour and not sweet.. the lady was so nice .. how do you complain! I had always wondered about this place near where I wander and now I wont wander back..
n1OlsoSv1wpVv_9DW7EbDg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	From previous experiences, this had become one of our favorite Chinese food restaurants in the valley. We went here for dinner tonight with high expectations. Tonight's visit was unbelievably disgusting! It started off with us receiving dirty silverware only to be replaced twice by none other than some more dirty silverware. Then the plates we received were dirty and had to be replaced as well. As if this wasn't disgusting enough, as we were eating, my boyfriend found a dead spider in his food! We brought in to the attention of the manager and he offered to bring us more food but who could eat after that? Needless to say, that was the end of our dining experience and we will not be returning.
Lq74UPBnhQ00vNCQAhiYow	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	My girlfriend and I ate here recently and I get nauseas thinking about this place. I ordered a seafood dish with noodles and veggies. The scallops were still very cold in the center. The little corncobs (cant think of the name) tasted stale in my dish as well as my girlfriends. I could only eat a few bites and I had to quit. I hate complaining when I go places and I should have said something to them, but instead I will simply not return and let others know to avoid this place. Simply put, the food sucks and this place needs to close.
D0nwwWoORNfOWQ3m-Ty2uA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Since new ownership in late summer of 2013 this once excellent restaurant is a shell of what the former owner built. I have lived in Moon Valley for 30+ years and the Bamboo house was a once a week stop. I will never return! Food quality has diminished, portion size diminished, bland flavor. Take out containers barely 3/4 full. I would welcome to discuss my thoughts with new owners as I am NOT the only one who believes this. My neighbors have the same feelings on the recent downfall of this once neighborhood favorite.
Ey9H9BPNz30A2qawljgPvg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	The last few times that I have been there, the food has been horrid. You ask for suicide hot and get sweet! Ask for crispy and get it so overcooked that it is chicken jerky. We went to go have lunch the other day and noticed that someone new was hanging a lunch special banner and I asked him if it was new owners. I was told it was. Unfortunately, the food is not the same and now I am looking for a new Szechuan place. Any suggestions?
HhHEvv80rnwKsybGE8Lk8A	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Beware of the fried rice! This place is in my neighborhood and one weeknight in March we went for the first time when family was visiting. We ordered fried dumplings to start, sautéed green beans, double sautéed sliced pork, beef with broccoli and chicken with mixed vegetables with an order of steamed rice for the table. I must say we all thoroughly enjoyed our food! I didn't care for the pork, thought it was too "porky" but everyone else liked it so I'm the outlier. The woman manager/owner comes up to us at the end, asks us how we liked our meal. I tell her we really enjoyed it, we live in the neighborhood and we'd definitely be coming back. Then this is where it went south. She asked us if we'd like boxes for our leftovers and we were debating whether to take the steamed rice. She says she can give us a carton of steamed rice packaged already and my husband says that if we take rice, we'd just take our leftover from the table rather than the carton she was offering. "We wouldn't want it to go to waste and take new rice." Her reply??? "Oh that doesn't go to waste, we use for something else." Oh really?? My husband asks what it is used for and I'm not joking...she replied "We use that for fried rice". We were speechless. And just so there is no confusion about what rice she was talking about, that we are absolutely clear we were talking about the half eaten rice ON our table she says, pointing to the bowl on our table, "see, it's like nobody really touches it anyway." I'm not joking. We left absolutely devastated! And though I really liked the food, I will not eat here again and cannot recommend it to anyone else. There are basic minimums I expect from a restaurant I patronize and reusing leftovers from the table is outrageous and unacceptable. So sad.
MMBMUlVcb74XjU33TA9lfA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Don't waste your money this was the worst Chinese I've ever had. Absolutely bland flavorless food I think they keep there costs down be removing all the ingredients from there dishes.
ULTBLSCbEDEA-0jpT-USmA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Please don't waste your time or money! Absolutely horrible, it taste as bad as the building looks! HORRIBLE SERVICE TOO!
M04esYNbH3DoXFYSEM73vA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Lady on phone was rude and would not take there coupon, food was not good, way too much breading on shrimp and general chicken was hard as a rock. I would have to pass not impressed at all, kids wouldn't eat it either.
d_PaoSX5w8lbZWjuDwBGlw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Alls I can say is can you find a decent Chinese place in this town I appreciate they can't speak English over the phone so I'm sure it's authentic but these people really don't know how to cook so unimpressed with the food I'm voting Panda Express over this garbage food Alls it was good for was dog food cause it wasn't edible
qNo2c136B_6DSd-QfZpdNA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	In summary, don't go here. I checked out this place on a whim and it was the mistake of the weekend. I picked up the curry combo plate because I was hoping to try the different types of food they have. The fried rice was simply rice with soy sauce and maybe somewhat fried? The noodles they had were pretty bland. The curry was really bland and watery.
LFgV6FebLmodvaiSVjdCrA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	My wife and I tried this place while waiting for a prescription @ the CVS down the street. We should have gone to DQ instead. I had the Yui-Shan Shrimp which was terrible. A flavorless sauce with tons of mushy green peppers and a few bamboo shoots sprinkled throughout. My wife had the Kung Pao Shrimp, which tasted like ketchup and soy sauce, there was no pao to be had. The egg roll was the best part, and only because it was packed with black pepper did it have any taste. We split an order of crab puffs, which were so tiny and overcooked there was maybe one small bite from each piece. The table setting was outrageous! Cloth napkins and delicately placed flowers gave me the sense that the Queen Mother was coming for a visit at any time. I politely paid the bill and left a tip, and will NEVER return there.
hOAXQhSrTRQozo6jDzcY3g	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Incredibly expensive and it took a hour and a half to get it to my door. Then once we got it we found out that they dont deliver won ton soup for take out but its on their menu! Then the food was yuck! I have had allot of Chinese food in my 44 years! This has to be the worst! I gave one star just cause we did not get sick! But short of that I would give zero stars if I could. That's how bad the food and the service was.
Pf96E3kN5a8-p7Bzxm_-rw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	While this food did not make me Kim Jong Il by any means and I don't particularly LIKE Chinese even....steer clear of this place. This was not my choice but it is nearby and unsuspecting hungry people may fall into the trap of ordering some delivery from here especially around the holiday's. Here is your warning. The food was bland no flavor, orange chicken was soggy, pot stickers were the worst I have ever had and I LOVE potstickers PEOPLE!! Chow mein was watery and tasteless. The ONLY thing that was decent was the crab puffs so next time I crave them I just might order them and maybe try some soup. What can I say I might be a glutton for punishment. ;) Oh also when visiting this shopping mall which I have done many many times this place is pretty much empty except for maybe lunch. FYI.
mJTmLjaM6JAF2LomcV5sdQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	If want a list of place to stay away. this is one of them. I think my one star tell you how I feel about this pit.
Yvj5w6igzPu4VRfuALEy6w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Beware when ordering they will not even attempt to correct there mistake! I ordered the shrimp and vegetable dinner combination. To my surprise when my food arrived it was just shrimp and vegetables not the combination. I called the store back, explained the problem, and told them I would pay for a full size fried and egg rolls ( to match my huge potion of shrimp and veggies). The girl on the line said it was no problem that they wouldn't charge me. About 3 min later a women with a heavy accent called and explained that I did not say I wanted a combination and they are too busy to come back. I was so appalled! I barely knew what to say! Too busy to come back and correct there mistake, especially when I offered to pay for it?! I ended up ordering from another place and will never order from this shop again. I would give them 0 stars if I could!
w0_dlssz2XZaHXNJoVCyrA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This particular Panda Express is so gross....I mean, it's clean. However, something is not quite right about the food they serve at this one. Or maybe I just stopped eating Panda Express or it's always been this way and I've been spoiled with delicious Chinese food in SF. It's not fair for me to compare Panda with that, but c'mon! Why does this place charge so much, but provide such low quality food?
naEJ_IbzoXSCec0-SlkLpw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I went to dinner here last night and the food was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours. They didn't have a very big selection and I was not impressed.
vSMpYoXeE8essTrwLgmehg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Gross..... that should say it all!! Zero stars!
rYdazQS0-obtNHyPXs3OEg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Don't go here if your hungry!
4ohEWT0nu3L3buQnmieaHA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Japanese Restaurants 1_star	I remember going to Sam's back in the day in Vegas and it was a fresh, easy fast-food spot. Yeah, not anymore - at least not this one. We walked in and the place looked like a strip-mall Chinese food place that hadn't been updated in decades and we wondered what had happened. The place was dirty. You can't see where the food is made, and maybe that was a good thing. We still ordered, and ate, cause we were too tired to stop anywhere else and hoped the food still stood up to memory. The drink station looked like it hadn't been cleaned in....a long time. Food and randoms all crusted in the corners of the containers the plastic utensils and sauce packets were in - yeah, no thanks, we will use our utensils at home. And yeah - the food was gross. Didn't seem fresh at all and just soggy. Seems like Sam's (at least this one) has seen it's Golden Years and now is just in decline. Oh well.
nR0R5UQMHM8rAo-on-pwTw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	This is what I get when I just drive by someplace and drop in. I had a crazy hankering for Chinese last night so I deviated from my normal practice of researching a place before I go there and I am especially careful when it comes to Chinese places. So I guess I got what I deserved when I made an impromptu stop at the Golden Wok. This place hit the home run of bad restaurants. Over-priced, bad service and horrible food! I could have had PF Changs for what I paid at Golden Wok. We ordered Lettuce wraps and the food was cold and I swear the chicken must have been 3 days old. Awful. Then I ordered Chicken Corn Soup because I love the way Abacus Inn in Phoenix makes theirs. But again, the chicken was tough and the soup had no flavor. Then we got our entrees. I had Lemon Chicken. I won't even go into how bad it was. Just go to your local supermarket and buy a frozen sweet and sour dish and you will get the idea. All of this cost me $50 and I drank water. When you are in a location like they have you have to do something compelling to bring people to your restaurant. Value priced food, exceptional service, or fresh ingredients. But Golden Wok just wants to be another bad Chinese place. Just like 10,000 other places in strip malls in the valley.
3jhCmIX3rE4hndujbrE4yg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Mediocre food. Good service. No need to return.
wGEWaZQbT8-i9zRk54xLMQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	We got take out from here, not expecting the best Chinese food in the world, but we were not expecting to get the worst! We did not like what we got at all. My white rice had a metallic taste to it, and the crab ragoons were very seafood-ish. I got a beef chow mien. The beef was ok but not great and we also got sesame chicken and they were very crunchy with little sauce. I would not recommend Chinese food from here!
1GLav-9CDwn2zQo2nCGJvQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	We did not have a good experience here. The food was bland and the quality of the ingredients was low. The server was slow and when we got the food to go sauce leaked out if the bag creating a massive mess. The containers just weren't able to hold all that bland flavor. If a one star rating doesn't tell you to skip it, I don't know what will.
ewCrAbX_H8Dl0lG7yZPkLQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Awful. All of the dinners came with the sauce on the side. What the? Ordered the Golden Wok Chicken and the General Tao's Chicken. Again, sauces on the side (why?!) and not much flavor anyway. This was definitely the Bud Light of Chinese take out.
h9Uq43ZSmZ3jFXPdDFZxtw	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Another disgusting tasting Chinese joint in Phoenix. My order was simple - steamed dumplings and wonton soup. The meat inside the filling tasted like something very questionable - not pork, not chicken, not beef. Something dark and oily and ominous. I could not eat either dish as both tasted as if they were filled with meat from the same mystery animal. Waste of money. So I ended up eating a small portion of a visiting relative's chicken and shrimp combo which was almost devoid of meat (might be a good thing, actually) and had absolutely no spice or kick or flavor. Will not be back.
Ahocv_tkfTXrGAQ0wplbhA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. I ordered Chicken Chow Mein. After waiting 40 minutes, it was delivered...with no noodles. So I called and told them that they brought me the wrong thing. They said they would run another one over. They brought the same thing again. Apparently, according to them, chow mein does not have any noodles besides a crispy noodle. I lived in San Francisco for 10 years, went to numerous Chinese food restaurants, and every time I ordered chow mein, it had noodles. It was gross. I will never order from there again.
4lnUOQ3XB9JoVFLcP_U7xA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Horrible food place was dirty and we found something in our vegetable low Keon that was neither vegetable or noodle. Looked like an insect and had a hard crispy outer shell. Made me and my wife want to vomit
Wd8cNbgpyrl9pU3HHjdbAQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Will never order again. Supposedly we got chicken chow mein, but I can't confirm it was actually chicken. We also got beef with broccoli. Broccoli seemed safe, but not sure what they grey meat was that came with it. Never will order again.
uGT_xanpPbzUJJ4ogeyx6w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Disgusting Chinese food. After the dirty diner let out that they had several major violations I knew I would never be back...
RMQOBVOOGEJuUOQgG5YZdQ	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I will not be ordering from here again. The only good thing I ordered was the cream cheese wontons. All of the vegetables had a really funky taste, and the garlic chicken had no garlic flavor.
0IYm_VsQryTa6TcoYIOcrA	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I ordered from this place for the first and last time tonight. The ordering process went well and I was quoted the average chinese restaurant delivery time (1 hour to an hour 15). After an hour and 40 minutes, my LUKEWARM order arrived. The lemon chicken that my boyfriend got tastes oddly like dryer sheets (it sounds sarcastic, but it's not) and my "mongolian beef" tastes like phoenix tap-water. It's got this dirty metallic taste. Very odd..... Oh, and our cream-cheese wontons are cold and rubbery. All this "great food" for only $31? Yippee! I will never order from this place again and I suggest you don't either.

MgROe2FDMx1KmxBTREihfg	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	The worst. I ordered chow fun, wide noodles. Got home and they were skinny noodles. Called them and got some bullshit response. They will NEVER get my business again.
dYARV9sbo22ILZUP-iNC8w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I ate this food for 10 years until they decided to not deliver my food and not answer the telephone. Do not order from this place. I REPEAT, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.
azCvGqDWAZl9FE_E5Dwg5w	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Ordered for delivery and after an hour and a half without my food I drove down and was told they had not even started my order. NEVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.
lLcmdsRb2sSRjB7JBOle8Q	Phoenix_AZ AZ Chinese Restaurants 1_star	Pretty bad when you order your food, it never shows up and they wont answer your calls. We drive down and they say they never even started our order. Stay away, Chinese food is not rocket science, this establishment is awful. Let's call it "No No China" as you won't ever get your food.
