2fJfR7RRA9ylerKLn7ucEA	Auto_Repair Automotive Tires Oil_Change_Stations 5_star	These guys are AMAZING! I brought my car in and they checked over the WHOLE car! I realize my car needs some TLC. The guys prioritized my list of things I need to get done and made me estimates too. I know I have alot of money I need to save to fix my car but the guys are helping me out and we are doing a little at a time. I LOVE the fact they told me EVERYTHING that was wrong with my car. They have a GREAT staff, a WONDERFUL warranty (2 years/24,000 miles on Parts & Labor), AMAZING technicians, and an attitude of service. I feel at home and will NEVER take my car someplace else, EVEN just for an oil change!!!
JJdtrQcq82KNS_2Q6-UZQA	Auto_Repair Automotive Tires Oil_Change_Stations 5_star	Matt and Tim were great. When going over solutions I felt they were straight forward and upfront about the cost of the repairs. I also felt that they understood how I felt about being separated from my money. Our Volvo is running great and we hope to keep it running for a long time with the help of Virginia Auto Service.
WD-jTNplqfvGM-dX46NIFQ	Auto_Repair Automotive Tires Oil_Change_Stations 5_star	Well, I have a little 2001 Ford Taurus. My lovely silver grandma car is fantastic for the 100-200 miles I drive per month. And now, my little car has a great shop looking after her. I took my car in as it was time for an oil change and I was convinced my serpentine belt was about to go. It had that tell-tale burning smell which was making me nervous. Turns out I had a loose oil-filter from my last oil change and dripping oil + catalytic converter = my car is about to die smell. Virginia Auto Service changed my oil and cleaned up my engine. It was so nice to receive a call from them saying my belt was fine and an oil change was all I needed. It was refreshing to be given an honest assessment vs being told some great story about some random repair that was needed...I am a female after all and have received some rather odd diagnoses in the past (your rotors fell off, so you'll need to have them replaced for example). It is very reassuring to know I now have an honest, kind and reliable repair shop for my car. Did my oil change run a bit more than some $19.99 special? Yes, but it was so worth it! Now my little one won't be getting an oil change for another year most likely, but my service advisor, Robert, asked me to please stop by every three months so they could check out my belts, tire pressure, etc just to be safe. Now THAT is service!
OWBgOTQ6sYB2Tob4wwaQZQ	Thai Restaurants 5_star	You won't be disappointed. We've eaten here about 7 times now, and we are ALWAYS delighted. The Beef Panang is just killer. The strips of beef are incredibly tender and of high quality. I usually find that the strips are a perfect medium (which I didn't know was possible in Thai cuisine). The sauce, ohhhhhh the sauce. Pour it over the rice (if you get it to go) and just love. Personally, my favorite is the yellow curry. Look, I've had Thai Elephant, Thai-E-Sam, Thai Basil, and another Thai joint in Phoenix that I can't remember. Yellow curry is my dish. It's absolutely the best here. Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing. The duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me happy. Appetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entrees. Another note: don't come here thinking this is 100% authentic Thai cuisine. It's definitely Thai...but upgraded. In my opinion, it's perfect. It's also a good place to take someone on his or her first taste of Thai.
Rqd_QdZ56wvcR9eO-HTnEg	Thai Restaurants 5_star	Wow, just realized my reviews were never finished... So, this is from a year ago at Thanksgiving. Haven't been back, but would definitely try it again. ************* We just returned from a delish meal at Wild Thaiger, after reading all the great reviews. I'm happy to say it didn't disappoint! We had appetizers as well as dinner, and everything was sooooooooo tasty! The presentation was pleasing, the portions outrageously large, and the service exceptional. Granted, we did have the place pretty much to ourselves (being the day before Thanksgiving...). Still, it was a great experience. We'll definitely be back!
1B04StfscZXqqgbf0_et0w	Thai Restaurants 5_star	Most of my reviews for Asian restaurants in Phoenix begin with something like, "it's good...for the area," but this place is just plain good. I'm a pretty serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai places. That being said, I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer at Wild Thaiger. My husband and I gave it a try for Dining out for Life when our first choice had a long wait. I've never been so happy I couldn't get a table somewhere. We sat outside on their patio which I would recommend to anyone. It's open yet cozy and comfortably cool. For our appetizer, we had the seafood pancake. I've never had anything like it but the description sounded too good to pass up. It's a crispy pancake full of sprouts, scallions, shrimp, mussels and squid. It was delicious and really unique. For dinner, I ordered the Decha Boar. The description listed it as being perfect for the "true Thai foodie." With a description like that, I had to order it. The dish was spicy and flavorful. I'd caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods. Different chiles effect people differently. My husband ordered the Ginger Fish. The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack. I could've taken a bath in it. Long story short: it was SO good. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items. They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with Thai flavors. Check this place out!
Fzriw9EDpUx0I0IVBprmvw	Thai Restaurants 5_star	After an intense therapy session, I came to Wild Thaiger to debrief. They have lunch specials and bottomless french-pressed tea. The organic green tea is my favorite. Everything was very delicious and refreshing. The patio is the style of restaurants on Washington Ave, Miami Beach. My 'Thai Spicy' green curry beef came out artistically and I took a picture. I saw other people taking pics of their food, as well. Who doesn't want to eat beauty? The soup was fantastic. I doctored it up with mad jalapenos and dry red chili paste. My nose was snotting down my face.. Cultural note to the haters: Thai people eat cockroaches as an after bar street fare. Jebus ppl! It's better than a bacon wrapped hot dog out the side of a utility van.
voV0zAlbEBBE7U9mxdJ9uA	Thai Restaurants 5_star	I went here when I was feeling a little under the weather and got the Super Soup. It was amazing! I got it spicy and it was most def really spicy! It was such a huge soup for 9$. I had one of my friends spring rolls which were one of the best I have ever eaten! I think its one of the best Thai places in Phoenix!
PWps86hR5UmXMlq7K73nqA	Thai Restaurants 5_star	Ordered lunch for pickup. It was ready when I got there, the place is clean, cool and refreshing. The food was SO FLAVORFUL!!!! No soggy bland phad thai here! The SO GOOD. :) I will DEFINITLY come here again.
CRXtSFGETE8sPW6eUaRkxQ	Thai Restaurants 5_star	This is a must try if you live in Phoenix and like Thai food. Great food, clean/hip place, great service, reasonably priced...what more can you ask for?
puFqSRRYhVtWMOs-oQTg8w	Thai Restaurants 5_star	Wow! The smell got me from the moment my dining partner and I entered. I could just tell things were "right" about this place. Then we saw the plates walk by..and the plates in front of the seated diners. I've paid a lot for smaller plates in the past. These plates could feed an army, and they are stacked with fresh cilantro, sprouts and frisee' beets. Truly a gorgeous spectacle of food. We could not believe the cheap price, too...$9 for the pad thai. It was THE BEST pad Thai we've ever tasted, and we've had it all over the country. Because the place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon lunch rush we were seated at the bar and served right away. I had the Thai iced coffee, served elegantly in a tall ice-filled glass. Strong and sweet. My dining partner had tea served in a French press. We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), shared a plate of fresh spring rolls, which are the best I've had since I ate them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9. The place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity. The bar over looks an open kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself. Photos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the head chef with some local celebrities and one with Steven Seagal. What were most impressive to us are the photos of their annual celebrations. Brightly costumed servers and performers...We want to know when these take place! If you love Thai...GO THERE!
nBH1Pu7vEbMwU6bY5P8QNQ	Thai Restaurants 5_star	Consistently the BEST Thai food in Phoenix!
82HurlzWy4KM7752wD6B6Q	Midwives Health_&_Medical 5_star	I've only been going here for just under a year. I'm expecting my first child and had a lot of questions, and everyone from the front desk all the way to the doctor answered every single one of them.. No problem. Dr. Gibson is my doctor, she is very helpful, and she has answered every question for me, she is kind and asks questions about my family just to get to know me. I feel very comfortable going here and I would recommend it to anyone.
XBn9GfZQUdqpiu0F1AisPg	Food Grocery Shopping Drugstores 5_star	Even though we have moved away from CenPho, my husband and I still use this Safeway Pharmacy. Quite frankly, they provide the very best pharmacy customer service I have ever experienced in my 14 years in the Valley. They know us by name. There have never been any hassles with insurance that they have not dealt with immediately. They communicate. They are fast and they are friendly. As a former Pharmacy Tech, I can tell you that their job can be downright awful sometimes, but we have never experienced anything but great service here. I have used Osco, CVS,and Walgreens in the past and have dealt with lost prescriptions, crappy service, errors on my prescription labels, and other incompetencies . None of that has ever happened at this Safeway Pharmacy. The only thing Safeway Pharmacy has been lacking that the big chains have is the ability to link to all their stores, but Safeway will have that capability soon, I was recently told. If you want both personal and professional service that is quick and error free, then transfer all your prescriptions from the Walgreens across the street like I did.
0f9O-gurD3G0zSzzFw4Xbg	Mexican Tex-Mex Restaurants 5_star	Long time user of Yelp...first time reviewer and Sam's is the reason! WOW...what a great restaurant and an even better experience. First, the chips & salsa that showed up as we sat down - Almost impossible to describe how good this combination of sweet, spicy, flavorful and tangy this kickoff to dinner was. You must go and you MUST have the chips and salsa...YUM! Then, dinner. And it was fast and delicioso! I had the Black and Blue quesidilla and my partner had a pork dish and holy cramoly...amazing. Not only was the service fabulous and fast, but the attention to detail was truly surprising AND, did I mention the food was fantastic! Then we met up with Nicole - manager extraordinaire and a really nice person to socialize with during dinner. She came over and asked how our dinner was going and then shared stories of her experiences with us and what's cool (and not so cool) about Phoenix. Always great to hear it direct from a local . . . thanks Nicole, you made our evening really special. And then finally, after all was said and done, our waitress Sally brought these little corn-husk wrapped fingerlings of vanilla infused white-chocolate with pecans encrusted throughout. Seriously...just shoot me! I'd give Sam's a 10 star rating, but then again, this is my first time reviewing a restaurant so, it's a pleasure to start off my Yelp career with such a great and wonderful place. PLUS, there's a Canyon Cafe' restaurant (parent company of Sam's) about 10 minutes from my house in St. Louis so as soon as I get back home, I'd headed there for more fun and food. Thanks Sam's...WOW!
-ermQSg9K19pzqvlWaH5UA	Mexican Tex-Mex Restaurants 5_star	One of our favorites. I love that you can walk right in on a Friday or Saturday night without waiting for a table - I don't know why that is, maybe the location? But the food has always been phenomenal. The seared tuna and fresh veggies is so good and the portion is twice the size I've ever gotten elsewhere - so it's a great lunch the next day. Chips and salsa are the best of anywhere. The chips basket is a mix of white and blue corn, PLUS fried wonton wrappers with a sweet/spicy spice blend AND sweet potato chips. Sooo good. And it's a great, roasted salsa too. I've had dinners, salads, quesadillas there and everything has always been good. I'd always take my assistant there for secretaries day or for their birthdays and they always love it. We've had out of town visitors and they always love it too. If you love calamari, there's is great. IT's cornmeal dusted with a spicy sauce... but there's TONS... so bring friends. Really. Usually a calamari order is $10+ and so small you don't want to share, this is under $10 and enough for 5 ppl. Delish. I LOVE that they bring you a white chocolate (and pecan) tamale after dinner. Just the perfect little two bites of sweet to finish your meal. Consistently good food.
Otr9PvcefaRfzynCqVNjaA	Food Tea_Rooms Breakfast_&_Brunch Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	The desire to bring my mom here is damn near overwhelming. Victorian antiques, kitschy decorations, and brocade wallpaper - and did i mention fantastic scones with Devonshire cream? I'm not even a girly girl (look for me slurping Irish breakfast tea in a Dramarama t-shirt), but I just can't help feeling frilly and feminine in this place. Spot on, my good man (translation: 'aw, hell yeah', for those less pasty).
M-uVMuFi0HhRPkJGO1zicg	Churches Religious_Organizations 5_star	If you are looking for a classic Catholic church in Phoenix, this is it. St. Mary's Basilica has a beautiful sounding choir, wonderful priests and a historically Catholic feel with architecture and structure. I think it has something to do with the fact that Pope John Paul II visited this basilica years ago for World Youth Day. I've been going to St. Mary's Basilica for years. Ironically enough, Father Vince, who is a priest at St. Mary's Basilica, used to be the priest at St Isidore's in Danville, California which was the church I went to when I was growing up. During the holidays, I make sure I attend mass at St. Mary's Basilica. There's something about the architecture, music, and Mass that makes this a perfect church for those times. However, it's also a great church for Sunday mass. Around 7 years ago, my sister married her husband at St Mary's Basilica and I was lucky enough to be the Maid of Honor. The wedding was a full Mass and made it such a special day for my sister, her husband, myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony. There isn't much more I can say about St. Mary's Basilica in this review, but I will end this by saying that each Mass is a different experience and it's based on the person attending, but be sure to visit this church and attend a Mass so see if it's right for you.
epCzl8N32Jj8zfIVOjwxeA	Arts_&_Entertainment Performing_Arts 5_star	It's an amazing theater!! The theater is beautiful and the seats are comfortable. Advice: Avoid sitting on row C. Evidently rows A & B were "under the stage," so on row C, we were even with the stage. I've sat on the front row before at other theaters and have never been so close to have to look up. Next time I'll choose seats more toward the middle of the theater. If you'd like a hot appetizer during intermission, order it before the show.
uRv2LpT9nK1R-yLjmS7k8g	Bars Restaurants American_(Traditional) Sports_Bars Nightlife 5_star	This place is awesome! Great atmosphere, cheap prices on drinks and food, and really tasty bar food. The cotton club room is the best!
RFfE9jO4VArp_fRk1UWbcA	Bars Restaurants American_(Traditional) Sports_Bars Nightlife 5_star	Great service..great food...very fast!
m9j1pHDGbImvkZjaYYF-ug	Mexican Restaurants 5_star	I was extremely happy with my meal here. The salsa with the chips was nicely spicy. I had the shrimp and octopus a la Diavolo. The Diavolo sauce was delicious and also spicy in a different way than the salsa for the chips. I was given a large flour tortilla and couldn't resist dipping and redipping. The sides of salad (standard shredded lettuce, etc., but very fresh and crunchy), rice and refried beans were substantial. After the chips, main course, salad rice and tortilla I couldn't do more than scratch the surface of the refried beans. I was equally happy with the atmosphere and service. I showed up near 1pm on Sunday as a single diner. Most of the other people were family groups, many apparently regulars. I was nonetheless given a decent table normally seating four after the promised 10-15 minute wait and no sense of being rushed or treated differently by any of the staff. Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be eager to come back (bringing family and/or friends) and have the same thing again and/or explore the rest of the menu.
pL1hDe124uIKeaAgZLZYGg	Mexican Restaurants 5_star	I've long been searching for the best camarones diabla and have found that gem here in their camarones endiablados offering. This spicy seafood dish hit all the right notes! My husband also loved their cheese crisp and cheese enchiladas. I've not been to Mexico but I would bet this is real deal Mexican cuisine.
jzEwJPwnByV9DCD1IrWJAw	Mexican Restaurants 5_star	You can find me here every Tuesday night. You see they have a daily rotating specials menu and it so happens to feature the best veggie burrito (this is saying a lot coming from me, since I am obsessed with burritos and have lived in Phoenix for most of my life) for a little over $5 on Tuesdays! It is so massive.. if you know the size of a Chipotle burrito, imagine that, but doubled! Seriously, it consists of two very large tortillas, which are needed to whole the damn monster of a burrito together. This happens to insure that the contents don't spill out of the tortilla! Genius. I am fairly sure this burrito weighs more than most new born babies.. yes, that's even considering how all the hormones people consume today are making babies larger each year - this burrito would still out weight them my friends! Anyhow, the burrito is large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals. Awesome for $5. The guac that they make is top notch, and their rice is truly amazing. It all tastes very authentic, and I love that I can easily make it vegan since they don't add any secrets into their food. I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour cream, and they have never once slipped up on this! Which also keeps me coming back. Oh, and the salsa bar is to die for! I am usually creeped out by salsa bars (think Baja Fresh - yuck) but they actually make some damn good salsas and usually have a bowl of chopped onions... I can never get enough. I think my personal favorite salsa is called something like Salsa Fresca - it's usually all the way to the right. Be sure to try it with your free chips. On top of everything I love about this place is the fact that it is so close that I can walk there in a few minutes. Although I hate strip malls, I am glad that this little joint is downtown and not somewhere completely stupid. Stop by and check it out when you want some affordable, authentic tasting AND high quality Mexican food.
jAGooJFJheBJx1tnnkFbNA	Japanese Sushi_Bars Asian_Fusion Restaurants 5_star	This restaurant is a perfect example of why I give my money to local business owners. This is a sparsely decorated gem in Midtown Phoenix. In an area full of lunch only, counter order spaces, one would think this wouldn't be welcome. I love a rice bowl every now and then and this one is extremely high quality and stocks every type of rice bowl imaginable. I've had the Oyako and Teriyaki both multiple times and they are delcious. You definitely wait a few minutes for your food, and that is a good thing because it means they are not mass producing food and waiting for people to order it, like Tokyo Express does. Good food alone though, won't garner a five-star review for a rice bowl. What pushes Blue Fin over the top is the ownership. The little old Japanese lady who owns and runs the restaurant during lunch time is one of the absolute nicest people I've ever encountered. She welcomes every customer, and speaks to you in a genuine family like manner. She does not come across as fake or ass-kissish. I just get a calm, warm, and welcome feeling from this woman when I come in here. It's not even just her either. Her staff always looks happy, and has run of the soda fountain, water, lemonade, etc. Everyone just seems to be happy. It's true that if you take care of your staff, they make your customers happy as well. Many other places make me feel so unwelcome around here at lunch time, but I can always count on Blue Fin to treat me like family and give me a solid rice bowl.
gBgXxSXzKFimOtx2ULGzbg	Japanese Sushi_Bars Asian_Fusion Restaurants 5_star	Delicious terriyaki chicken ... and always delivered with a huge smile. Blue Fin is a family operated business. The people who work there are the absolute nicest people in the world! You can tell they really enjoy cooking for their customers and they make you feel like family when you eat there - even if it's you're 1st time there. You need to try this place if you haven't. GREAT FOOD, GREAT PEOPLE, AND GREAT PRICES.
pDPclVpOhOF1nzPs3ZKzTw	Nightlife Bars American_(New) Sports_Bars Restaurants 5_star	Came here after a company christmas party with a few co-workers. Service is great, happy hour pricing is right on point. Carmella (Sorry If I'm spelling your name wrong) is an amazing, friendly, knowledgable server. Huge out door patio. Great fun. I'll be back again.
bjSlWVEOb9pBHRtfRf3UyA	Nightlife Bars American_(New) Sports_Bars Restaurants 5_star	We held a brunch at Coach and Willies for family memebrs on sunday after our wedding. The manager Kevin had been in touch with me and had reserved us a private room just off the dining room for some privacy(at no extra charge)!!!! The service was excellent and the food was greatly enjoyed by everybody. We had people in from St Louis, Lexington, KY, Chattanoga, TN and everyone raved about the food. My wife and I eat there often for lunch and Sunday brunch. Food is always good and atmosphere is great with all the TV's. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone needing a great place to entertain.

wxnnrgJZJ18LOIwNM9Nrfg	American_(Traditional) Restaurants 5_star	I had an awesome experience at Tom's Tavern on Sunday. I live nearby and decided to visit for the first time with my girlfriend. We had the brunch buffet that had some good breakfast foods along with some munchies to enjoy during the games. Although we weren't drinking, the bar has happy hour prices which I'm sure many others enjoyed. During the game, a pair of Arizona Cardinal cheerleaders came in and started fraternizing with fans which was an awesome addition to the experience. I will definitely be returning.
aG9elPUhOBnq6_I_y5DKMA	Car_Wash Automotive 5_star	Excellent customer service and high quality of work here are worth a little extra driving for me to get my car washed. Most importantly for me, it's one of those places where I don't feel like I have to strip my car of all possible valuable items or papers with personal info when I get out and hand the keys over.
Z7jo6d2quia28KfohRkWeA	Italian Pizza Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	Great place, great food, and a beautiful environment. Friendly family owned place, good prices, lots of great options. Could eat here every day of the week!
fPKTahRJ02R4IOn7KQkyQw	Japanese Restaurants 5_star	Our neighborhood, locally-owned sushi place and NOT a chain (as someone suggested in another review). I had to weigh in because we have been going to Ichi Ban for 7 years and the owner, Seth, and his staff have been consistent, attentive and friendly. And the sushi is fresh, creative and tasty in my opinion. Order something off the "specials" menu posted on the wall and you can't go wrong with the spicy tuna. It also isn't as expensive as other sushi restaurants and there are other menu options for land lovers. Great sushi place for lunch or dinner and right on the light rail.
ap7Xkt4lX04_1gnwwsF-Ug	Barbeque Restaurants 5_star	This place is da bomb! This is my go to place whenever I'm in Phoenix. Great food, great prices, great staff. And the portions are huge so you'll never leave here hungry. I've had the ribs, beans, sweet potato fries, and sweet potato pie and they are all great. Now they just need to open a location in Los Angeles...
ACN6_HYz-uPqk1RKXdOUYQ	Wine_Bars Bars American_(New) Nightlife Restaurants 5_star	As Gabi likes to regularly point out to me, I did move over a year ago and I am closer to Cheuvront. I suppose it is time for an update. My initial review of 5 stars has not changed. Not every visit to Cheuvront has been a 5 star visit, but over time I have come to know what dishes and wines that I prefer. I am a frequent visitor to Cheuvront because I like the atmosphere it provides within the downtown area and it takes less than 5 minutes for me to walk there. It provides a relaxed environment where you can enjoy wine or a cocktail and order food based upon how what you are in the mood for. A full dinner? Sure. Just dessert? You got it. A small nosh? Why not. I find myself here most often for small plates and cheese, very rarely do I have a "regular" entree. It is not to say that they aren't good, they are and they are quite large, I just enjoy the variety of the menu. My favorite time of year at Cheuvront is the fall, as I think that their best dishes involve traditional fall ingredients such as butter nut squash and pumpkin. This is also my favorite time to partake in their extensive cheese list. Their international plates, while may seem expensive at first glance, are literally overflowing with cheese and meats. Happy Hour can be a fun time, although I am personally not a fan of many of the mixed cocktails that they feature. This works out just fine, as the wine list has many choices that I am happy to order at 25% off. The $5 tapas offered during HH are great compliments, my favorites being the gnocchi, ceviche, and the mac and cheese. (Really, any of their mac and cheese options are great). The relaxed atmosphere and consistent food and service have made Cheuvront into one of my favorite places in Phoenix, and possibly my favorite place downtown.
I_D-Ga-hkokQlqvW7uHjOg	Wine_Bars Bars American_(New) Nightlife Restaurants 5_star	Life is good when a place as amazing as this is right off the light rail line that you can walk to from your house (and I can). I have been meaning to go for ages and finally a group of friends wanted to go out of dinner, two of them which now live downtown, and I recommended Cheuvront. A half hour ride from the Mill Avenue stop and I was there. A bit chilly to sit outside but looks like excellent outdoor seating. The seating is well spaced with wine storage along the back wall and a well stocked bar in the middle (God and I both love a well-stocked bar, or at least I always say "Thank God, they have a bar). The wait staff was cordial without being too personal (I look at dining as I'm out to eat dinner with friends, not really out to make new friends, at least until I have a few drinks but that is whole different situation....ahem). I started out the evening with a basic mojito made with 10 cane rum. A little too much sugar syrup for my taste and could use more lime but wow, served in a full size glass and a kick like a mule. One of my fellow diners had the white sangria with fresh basil and wow, that was a keeper. I'm definitely having that next time. They have a huge selection of cheeses from around the world and we ordered the three cheese appetizer plate (the waiter asked if I wanted to pick but was happy to pick a selection for us, and I love to delegate) and the pork empanadas with orange marmalade. The cheese was good and I noticed they also have another book where you can order wine and they just pair it with cheese, how cool! The empanadas, to die for, I will order that again, ideally along with that sangria with fresh basil. Dinner was the duck breast rubbed with coffee and ancho chili pepper and served on top of I don't know what but it had a crispy grilled crust on the outside and it was nice and cheesy (seemed like some sort of rice and cheese mix) on the inside, and it was wonderfully presented. I actually had the recommended wine pairing and wow, it went so well together. A rich red wine that offset the spice rub on the duck breast perfectly. We ended the evening with coffee and desert. The coffee was okay but they should consider serving coffee roasted at the Cartel coffee lab in Tempe (which I love) as the coffee here was just...coffee...which was a shame when the rest of the meal was so great. Ideally they should bring everyone an individual french press so they can let the coffee get as strong as they like to drink it. I would also recommend a thicker cream, even whipping cream (unwhipped) since it provides that sense of luxury that goes well with this place (I had that at Mucho-Gusto and became an instant fan). For those of the more intellectual persuasion, I noticed this place is in walking distance of the main Phoenix library. So you can go pick out a good book on a lazy Sunday and then walk over to Cheuvront for some wine and cheese and feel like the perfect elitist, before you ride the light rail home (okay, this is my ideal lazy Sunday and I've always dreamed of being just a little bit of an elitist - I'm not perfect).
ZE5HsD_GAPxi9s5PsX99LQ	Wine_Bars Bars American_(New) Nightlife Restaurants 5_star	Few things make me happier than wine and cheese -- so naturally, I enjoyed the Cheuvront! I wasn't in the mood to make any decisions myself (it was Friday, after all) so I let one of the owners surprise me with his favorite red wine and a cheese plate. The shiraz he picked was delish, and the cheese plate, especially the brie, was equally yummy. I'd suggest you go for happy hour, sit on one of the comfy couches, ask your server or an owner for their recommendations, and try a bunch of stuff!
MSQ0SW2w31nQ1gQd9KwTKA	Bars American_(Traditional) Nightlife Sports_Bars Barbeque Restaurants 5_star	I was one of 50 people who went there to get Adam's Big Unit. The service was top notch and they move fast and get work done. And the hot dog was sooooo huge and soooooo good. I shared my picture of eating the big unit with Sebastian Bach and he commented back on it because it was so enormous! It had great flavor and my favorite brioche bread. I will be going back to attempt the dog on my own. I am a tall skinny girl but I have a true appetite so I will definitely get that 22" hot dog down no problem. I highly recommend Cooperstown. It is a great place to have good food and have a great time!
NSxRX1MvdI8Yrmp0hVoHZg	Bars American_(Traditional) Nightlife Sports_Bars Barbeque Restaurants 5_star	Some of the best food I've ever had! Came here last year for spring training with my girlfriend, buddy, and my little brother and it was so fun. We watched the NCAA tourny on all the big screens and their food is so good. My lil bro got those huge hot dogs. Good memories to look back on.
e2MdvwYai9EkGf-qv-LRzA	Bars American_(Traditional) Nightlife Sports_Bars Barbeque Restaurants 5_star	Hot diggity dang this place is just of the hook tasty. The big unit is this huge amazing hot dog, with chili, relish, tomato, jalapenos, and cheese. Also tried the brownie dessert and oh mylanta....it was orgasmically delicious!
0OF5luNq-KfUuZt4E_8KBw	Bars American_(Traditional) Nightlife Sports_Bars Barbeque Restaurants 5_star	The food is awesome, the atmosphere is super and the wait staff is pretty friendly. I had the big unit hot dog and it was quite tasty but I could not finish it. The food was quite good as was the place itself with the decor was pretty cool. The music was rock as expected and basically this is a better version of Hard Rock Cafe.
aFNNgIJndtkOaDoKY7tRbg	Bars American_(Traditional) Nightlife Sports_Bars Barbeque Restaurants 5_star	The atmosphere here is just so cool. Even if you don't like Alice cooper the rock and roll feel is all around. The staff wears Alice cooper-esque outfits and even the makeup! This is a huge restaurant and there was plenty of room to sit, mind you there wasn't a game on when we went. My friend and I both had the Marge Simpson Mac and cheese, it was heavenly. They put some tiny pieces of potato chips on top and it's just excellent. The service was quick and friendly. I really enjoyed my time here. It's a great restaurant for families, couples or singles and looks like it would be a decent bar in the evenings. Sort of reminds me of the Hard Rock Cafe, but I like this place better.
PVPgJ4viO3k6lJkZTuZ8WQ	Bars American_(Traditional) Nightlife Sports_Bars Barbeque Restaurants 5_star	I am sure someday I will have a bad experience at this legendary Sports Bar, but not tonight. I have made it a habit to come to Cooperstown prior to ball games and concerts for over 15 years. I anticipate keeping that tradition for years to come. So many of the sports themed bars and restaurants in this area are lost to the culinary Sonoran graveyard. Alice Cooperstown still stands for a reason. The staff is friendly and fun loving, the menu diverse and in unison with the rocking roll and sports themed decor. I usually get the BBQ sampler or the incredibly stacked nachos, but tonight I went for the simplicity of the Tom Brady Burger. It was "Spot On." The bacon was crisp and plentiful and the burger itself was perfectly cooked with a smoky charbroiled taste. The fries were fresh, crisp and spiced perfectly. I opted for two Kiltlifter beers, from local microbrew Four Peaks Brewery. The beer was available on draft served in nicely chilled her glass. Giant screen television monitors are strategically placed throughout the cavernous restaurant so every seat can view the game or games. The only negative remark actually is as a result of their popularity: You may have to wait a while on big game or concert nights, plan for that contingency arrive early and enjoy the fun. "UNIT!"
gZSjxADZWcZglmQaJW4oOA	Arts_&_Entertainment Stadiums_&_Arenas 5_star	I've gone here for many different events and the stadium never fails. Everything is so big and nice, even the bathrooms are nice! The seats are not rock hard like other stadiums. Parking is everywhere around the place and theres always spots so you don't have to walk far.
_doHqV31B_AKidQN-2wZiQ	Hotels_&_Travel Event_Planning_&_Services Hotels 5_star	This hotel is fantastic! The staff is amazing, friendly and super helpful. The rooms look newly renovated and very clean. The breakfast is yummy and the location good. That's the place to stay when you are in Phoenix.
QzmAtdI6S5QXGzj1tSbSYw	Hotels_&_Travel Event_Planning_&_Services Hotels 5_star	A great place to stay if your in town for a game. Within walking distance of everything. The rooms aren't that bad either.
Us3IVgpUaWfZcMZpm3TJmg	American_(Traditional) Restaurants 5_star	I live across the street and visit often. Could not ask for a better atmosphere with a view of the inside of Chase Field! The customer service has always been great. Often times it get dinner to go and the bartenders are friendly and chat it up while I wait. Just the traditional Fridays menu but the location makes it worth going. Definite place to check out when you are downtown. Doesn't have to be a game day.
ltxZhKx7k0XKLjPHxMA_Kw	Arts_&_Entertainment Art_Galleries Shopping 5_star	A great little place to see shows, very small, very intimate, a great setting for seeing a band. If a band you want to see is playing here, be sure to go, it doesn't get anymore up close and personal than this. There is no seating or alcohol, so if you don't mind standing and being sober, it is well worth it. The art here is some of First Friday's best, as far as I am concerned, leagues above all the other galleries. Be sure to stop and see the art here if you are out then.
OkFnpwRwJp9BRqANnX5DPA	Arts_&_Entertainment Art_Galleries Shopping 5_star	Love the Modified! i have been coming here since i was a wee freshman in highschool! one of my favorite venues in phoenix, gets crowded and loud stinky and awesome in a hurry, or it can be empty pensive and introvertedly artsy! just depends i suppose. I cant wait to be back, check out their events calendar on their website for gallery shows or concerts or film viewings. love you modified see you this friday hopefully?
m_WmKJ2hsvsNC674zY_KJA	Bars Nightlife 5_star	Very cool place. Located right next to Pizzeria Bianco and ran by the same owners (they get their drinks from here for the restaurant). Staff was amazing and the atmosphere was super chill and relaxed. Great place to have a drink under the stars in Arizona. We walked over to have a drink while we waited for our table at the pizzeria and time went by so fast that we weren't ready to go when our table was ready. But staff was so kindly to take our drinks over for us. A must if you're in the area.

EC8xiXvEcaiJtiEO3MWlrQ	Greek Mediterranean Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	LOVE this place! I eat here on a monthly basis and always have great services and food. It's affordable and quick! Definitely worth checking this place out!
igqD14Bqy4UWMddwym1i9A	Museums Arts_&_Entertainment Art_Galleries Shopping 5_star	Fun place, a lot of different things to see and touch . My two year old daughter had a great time specially in the water playground. This is a perfect place to bring your kids in the summer since is indoor and air conditioned.
zVD7mbVpjgn-qri7tAf9cA	Mexican Restaurants 5_star	The refried beans are better than chocolate! Worth the drive!
MGikWpzvjGuCLENzsjUsjA	Mexican Restaurants 5_star	My favorite spot for Mexican food in the valley. I've been going there for years specifically for the white menudo. Their ground beef/potato tacos are incredible and I love that some of the servers have been there the entire time I have been going.
aMtVjFCkQXVHHqc22i3AMg	Bars Gay_Bars Nightlife 5_star	We love the Cash. It is one of the few bars that have a smoking patio that you can drink on. We have donated a lot of stuff to raffle off for charity events at the Cash. They always have a great turnout. The crowd is extremely diverse. The drinks are good and cheap, and the bar staff is very friendly.
u2ZAV1cGBkyTKDikC7rL5w	Bars Gay_Bars Nightlife 5_star	This place is awesome! My favorite lesbian bar in town!
II1Kmz5lyB4yJVLrhMPULg	Burgers American_(Traditional) Fast_Food Restaurants 5_star	I don't know what everyone else on here is talking about; this Whataburger is super fast! The entire drive thru process took a grand total of four minutes. Great place to stop for a quick lunch when you work downtown.
dm9FMzMpXFHfHuG2cscJXg	Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	Dear That's A Wrap, I've only met you once, but it was love at first sight... I found you easily - on 7th street just north of McDowell and lots of parking in your private lot made me happy. I walked in and felt comfortable immediately - very casual, laid back atmosphere and welcoming staff. Since my lunch companion was a little late, I had time to observe the place, the menu, and even read a New Times that was out for your patrons. A few things I noticed during my wait: 1 - you are incredibly fast and efficient! 2 - you have smoothies on the back of the menu and they look delicious! 3 - you don't mind when people special order 4 - I didn't hear any whining or complaining at all while I was there The list could go on, but my friend arrived and we ordered. I had the 'Veggie Jackson' wrap - no onions or rice, add tofu with a side of fresh fruit. My friend had the 'Very Brady Clubster' with a side of fruit as well. We both commented how delicious our wraps were and the fruit was good too! The veggies in my sandwich were grilled to perfection and the combination of flavors from the feta and balsamic salsa blended just right. I felt like each bite was a party in my mouth. Sounds cheesy, but I swear, it's true! Serving size was perfect and so was the price! (Everything on the menu is $6.95 or less and even if you add chicken or tofu, it's less than $1). It's going to be kind of a hike for me since I'm moving further north, but I will be back for sure... See you soon, my new love! :)Gabi
5TiqEUIzvTXI0NdYjl3SPg	Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	Cool place, just wish I had been coming here more often. It's in an old house so it has that cool "old school downtown" vibe about it. Pretty healthy menu items with funny names that you'll be sure to remember, like Cheech and Dijon Chicken, The Very Brady Clubster,Teriyaki 90210, Gringo Star, In Like Fin, Rocky VII, The Veggie Jackson, and Bird Is The Word , just to name a few. I had the Prince of Thai which I really enjoyed. Just spicy enough for my tastes. I tried the pasta salad as a side and was impressed that it wasn't oily or had too much useless stuff on it, simple is good. At $6.95 I thought it was a heck of a lot better than a drive through or a sub sandwich. I'll be back soon to try one of everything on their menu!
8tz7kuFdES02yksLIOGgAw	Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	Love love love this place! Seriously, a place in Phoenix that is locally owned, has great prices, great food and buys local is pretty hard to find. My favorite wrap is the Gardin'n salad as a wrap. My only complaints about this place are the hours and the parking! But still well worth it.
_ck8yGoIEgZY6exQ90IKWw	Grocery Mexican Food Ethnic_Food Specialty_Food Restaurants 5_star	Words cannot express my love for La Tolteca. Well, not English words and I no habla Espanol. But I'll try... SUPER NACHOS MOTHERFUCKER!!! Nacho cheese, tons of cilantro, chicken, beef, beans, onions, tomatos, salsa, more cheese piled into a HUGE box. A huge box! ............................................................................... THUD I just passed out. Also great everything else. and cheap as hell. Like pesos cheap. !ah dios mio!
ab_YKDmdSsXnYM0MTX9v8g	Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Having lived in the neighborhood for eight years, I can't say much other than: variety, reliable, authentic. But what I'm really compelled to tell you all about is... They now serve Thai! In addition to their already huge menu! The Chicken Pad Thai is arguably the best I've ever had (I've had it in New York and San Francisco). Its crazy how good it is... I had to have it two days in a row to confirm. I've had the green curry and that was yummy - fresh veggies in everything, crispy and plentiful. IMHO, their decor rocks! I love the cheesy waterfall in the front, the chairs with coffee cup designs and giant turntable-centered family-sized tables. The green walls are an upgrade from the pink and blue that was there before. Go to Fate if you want to sit in faux-modern Ikea surroundings. This place is classic Mc Do Well
buE-dL4Pl_MWYZ-HhBpc3A	Chinese Restaurants 5_star	Adam M. was absolutely right: The Chinese Broccoli in Garlic Sauce and the Mixed Seafood Hot Pot (Casserole) are really, really amazing! I've also become a big fan of the Tomato Sauce Shrimp - tastes nothing like what you're thinking. Eat these items we recommend or be seriously disappointed trying the chinese staples you've become brainwashed into enjoying elsewhere.
AI7I-W_BiHLYuLScoNYLyg	Chinese Restaurants 5_star	I would like to make my rating based on three things: Food quality, customer service and consistency. I've tried MANY asian food establishments here in the valley since moving here three years ago and this is by far the best I've had! I usually order To Go and my food is always ready before I get there and am greeted with a kind hello and an appreciative smile (how nice!). I've ordered from them many times and have been impressed everytime. Thank you for the great food!!
cs0RCjz6UXpYWmfueODhfg	Arts_&_Entertainment Art_Galleries Shopping 5_star	I loved this place. I've only been to one event here, but it was awesome. I love how it's a historical house, and how they support local artists and events. The staff was all very nice, the decorations were unbelievable, and the yard was beautiful It looked like parking could be difficult, but we took a taxi which worked out perfectly. Just be aware of parking issues if you drive.
3lSyQBTk5PKxja6s_ysf2Q	Food Grocery 5_star	They have It all :) Moved into the neighborhood a month ago and from water refills, to old fashioned fuses (guest house still uses them) sandwiches and Spicy Dill Pickles.. Yum.. everything you can think of and the nicest Employees.. Coronado is lucky to have Sunshine Market. Love this place :)
hz8XzyNq5ICEzIMQ8poFUw	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	For those that haven't heard, Payton Curry has taken over Welcome Diner April through May on Sun, Mon, Tues, and First Fridays. Get there... now. Payton is known for pushing limits and incorporating fresh, local ingredients. The menu will likely change every week, if not every night, so I'm not sure if my recap will help all that much, but here goes. The neighborhood is sketchy, the place is tiny, and the accommodations are "rustic", so if you're all into the Scottsdale scene or flashing your dough, don't bother. That being said, Shantal mentioned that being there made her feel like she was camping every night, and I have to admit the evening had a vacation feel to it... National Lampoon's style! You can instantly tell that Payton is having a blast and it shows on his face and in the food. We were seated on a collection of old dining chairs at a makeshift table of 2x8s and construction horses in the middle of the front yard, with a candle to light our way... I knew it was going to be a sweet evening! We started with the burrata that was lightly seasoned with truffle oil and cracked pepper. Unfortunately a lot of people are adding burrata to their menus and they have no idea that this fresh, creamy, delicate version is how it's truly meant to be. It was served with slices of toast that I expected to be the brick-hard version to which I've become accustomed. Imagine my surprise as I bit into a spongy, buttery slice of bread with just a crunch of the crust! Delicious. The porcini foie gras terrine will scare those faint of heart, but it's amazing and the pear butter adds this velvety, sweet flavor that just makes it unforgettable. I wasn't a fan of the pate', but it was a combination of pickle, horseradish, and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf... all things I can personally only handle in moderation individually and generally dislike, so it was exactly as described. The mains arrived and the Sonoma lamb sugo proved to be an interesting choice. It's not something you would eat on a regular basis, but I'm so glad I got to try it. The shreds of lamb meat were piled on top of a bowl of hearty fettuccine with perfectly cooked chickpeas and dollops of cream that muted any gaminess of the meat. Then you would get a bite of golden raisin to kick in a touch of sweetness; pretty cool combination of flavors and textures without being over the top. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the bowl of Bolognese that was planted in front of us, it blew me away and I have no idea why!! Payton, what's your secret with something so simple? Dessert followed with apple pie that could've been much tastier if it were warmed with a scoop of ice cream, but all was rescued with a huge chunk of bread pudding that puts my mother's recipe to shame (and it was served warmed with a scoop of ice cream :). All in all, we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end. If you want a hint of adventure, get to Welcome Diner before the end of May... seriously... National Lampoon's style. ps: It's BYOB!
KGHmF3kUXZAwS4RDlFuyBg	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	Do you love good food? Duh. Do you love good drinks? Of course. Do you love good people? Who doesn't?! If you've answered yes to any of these questions (and we both know you did), you need to get down to The Welcome Diner. The cozy quarters and kitchy decor make it easy to fall in love with, and the staff makes you comfortable enough to stay for hours. AND THE FOOD! I have yet to try something that didn't make me smile. It's hard to pick a favorite dish but personally, I love the Kiltlifter braised pork biscuit. The carolina mustard sauce that's made in house, is probably the best thing I've ever tasted. And the made from scratch biscuit it comes with, is too good for words. Beyond a fantastic, locally driven food concept, they also make one of the greatest cocktails I've ever enjoyed; the Hurricane. And even though you clearly hear the bell dinging from the kitchen and everyone inside scream, "HURRICANE!" each time you order one, you just can't seem to figure out how you got so tipsy; they're sneaky little guys. So, next time you're out and about downtown Phoenix on a weekend, you should go say hi, and then eat your face off. You'll be glad you did.
04B3JYhiZ3Qei0kXe_tE7g	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	Well, I am trying to eat my way through the menu, but they keep adding delicious new dishes, so it's taking a while. The service at this place cannot be beat. When you are seated outside, every member of the team will be by to inquire about your experience and see if there's anything more they can do. When you're seated inside, you are a part of the whole Welcome Diner experience. I most recently had the smothered pork plate, which was pulled pork with a beer and onion gravy over a bed of jasmine rice, with sides of delicious collard greens and house-made poblano hush puppies. It was a heaping plate of food for $11.50. The next night, we returned, at my niece's request, and I had the Port of Call burger. It was yummy beefy goodness with perfect fries on the side. So, it's going to take me a while to sample everything the Welcome Diner has to offer, but I go at least weekly and I am dedicated to sampling all the goodness they have to offer. This place is a gem. Don't tell anybody. Oh, yeah...Bike Rack!
FAXC5HrtMVZd7S7XuFU-7w	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	Coconut cream grits with collards and tomato sauce. As vegan as it gets, and so full of flavor! Had it twice...once on Thursday and again on Saturday. Ran into 4 friends while I sat at the counter Saturday evening. This place is the best.
Ej2ZbKiMT3QlWP-RULLrNQ	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	I live a couple blocks from this place and I would literally eat here every day if I could afford to. Though I'd probably end up with a few extra pounds to go with my empty bank account. But every day when they post their daily special up on their Facebook page, I just sit and drool over it. I've eaten here a handful of times and everything is so freaking good. Its comfort food at its best. And the staff is super friendly and helpful. They treat you like a regular even if its your first time. I love the fact that they source all their ingredients from local farmers and purveyors. I initially thought the prices were a bit on the high side, but once I realized just how well the locally sourced ingredients were prepared, I now feel like its a bargain. And I also love that they are open until midnight every day (except Monday). This is just the coolest little place to grab some great food, a good drink, and chill with really friendly people. I hope this place is around for a very long time.
qtU3X4v8sybd6PNEwu5Vqw	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	The people are really cool. Excellent food made from local ingredients. The chicken biscuit sandwich is yummy. Also, must indulge in the poutine. Fun place with lots of misters running over the picnic tables outside which kept us cool. Must check this place out for yourself.
gVEcUbLYFkLQQPYI3STgew	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	Love love love this place!! I've been here for brunch and dinner and everything was amazing!! My bf says their burger is the best burger he has ever had and I have to agree. Super juicy!! The bumblebee is on point too!! I can't wait to go back and try the bacon cheddar fries :) I recommend this place to all my friends when they ask for a awesome place to eat downtown. And they are open late!!!
6Bl0lOINl4QmNA0NV5Zazw	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	Out with my two boys,who, like me, enjoy exploring for great eats. Based on Yelp suggestions, I decided to give this place a shot. It was close to the art museum we were at, reasonable prices, and great food! It is hard to find food that has great flavor, and makes you feel like you are eating a meal made by momma. Staff was courteous and ambiance was hip. Thanks for the experience, we are definitely excited to come back!
ciuK1UMGFdMB0RomKgbuSQ	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	Whhhhaaaat?! I have not reviewed these guys?! It's possibly because I was hoping to keep them my little secret. These guys took their Old Dixie food truck and took over this unique and eclectic location that has been home to other popups over the last couple of years. Inside seating is VERY limited 8 built in stools against a small counter. I love sitting inside but I often enjoy their out door seating during the summer and especially on these beautiful Phx winter nights. [They do lunch and brunch as well.] The Food: I have enjoyed everything I have tried here. They are known for their biscuits, which are fairly large, sturdy enough to be used in their biscuit sandwiches but tender enough to enjoy with their homemade honey butter (the honey sourced from a small apiary in the neighborhood) or house made jelly/preserves or apple butter. Many of their veggies are often sourced out of the community garden when possible. They source locally as much as possible, and their menu adjusts seasonally, while keeping some of their popular favorites. They always offer vegetarian options and occasionally even vegan. [Skip the goat cheese on the beet tureen salad and that is a yummy vegan option] They make all food to order and honor substitutions or additions within reason. Heck, for dinner one night I ordered their biscuit with goat cheese and smoked apple butter (found on the dessert menu) and asked if they could add bacon. They gave me a bit of a raised eyebrow as they found the request unique and gladly served it up (and it was SOOO good) My favorites: Anything with their fried chicken. Anything with their biscuits. Their french fries are hand cut and fabulous. They smoke their own meats (and sometimes apples for their smoked Apple butter) so try the Carolina or any smoked sausage, pork chop, etc. that shows up on the specials board. Their burgers rock! (YOU HAVE to try the PB&B, well unless you have a peanut allergy). Their salads are lovely and tasty. They offer some select cocktails and a limited choice of liquor. But this doesn't matter because all you need to know is get a HURRICANE (or 3). You'll thank me later.
P44HKsKwIHLloJBJv5TxNw	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	My wife, the picky vegetarian had some bizarre avocado sandwich and a side of brussel sprouts. If we end up moving to Phoenix, this restaurant may be the reason why.
CPyq81wKQVbtiILWPpOa6A	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	Went back for dinner the other night. Party of four for drinks and food. It was great ... We had The Koko, Fried Green Tomato sandwich, Avacado Po'Boy and Little Birdy. Rounded out with Carol Fries and Brussels Sprouts. Mmmmmm, Mmmmmm Good. Added some drinks and friendly banter from Morgan and a good night was had by all! Thanks Welcome Diner for a great night!
wD8Ahfa0HHSmk2VzhvzqTQ	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	My family and I went to Welcome Diner last night. So, there were several different items ordered and EVERYTHING was so good! I had the fried avocado po'boy. The bread was toasted the perfect amount. There was a great pico de gallo and kale topping the fried avocado. That fried avocado was amazing! It was so creamy yet crunchy! Yum! My husband had the champion burger. He said it was really good, especially the bacon jam. My brother in-law has the big Jim. It was huge! A biscuit, giant piece of fried chicken and the thickest gravy ever! I tried some and it was so good! Creamy and sinful! The last thing I tasted was the Brussels sprouts. Omg! Goooood! They were crispy and tasty! Only downside was the fries were a little salty. I would definitely go back. The atmosphere is exactly what downtown Phoenix is all about! I loved it!
MkxbwLX02NrzMYTKt4rtqQ	Soul_Food American_(Traditional) Diners Restaurants 5_star	It was a really cool environment and unique from the vast majority of the Phoenix area. We enjoyed their commitment to fresh and quality ingredients. Everything we ordered was delicious and reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly and prompt. HIghly recommend to come after dark in the summer because it is so blazing hot (mostly outdoor seating). We will definitely be returning for more pulled pork fries!
TGmL4R142OTdAnVg3pm8ww	Adult_Entertainment Nightlife 5_star	[DISCLAIMER: the rating of five stars for Bandaids does not directly correlate with the intentions of the establishment, instead, the volumes of unintentional comedy and unsolicited astonishment that may be had at this specific joint] Walking into Bandaids was like witnessing the sneak premier of the cinematic masterpiece 'Showgirls' -- and what I mean is, one is piqued with curiosity, wonderment, the promise of mindblowing mockery, and the anticipation of an inevitable Spidey exit. This is where the comparison to showgirls ends. Actually, I don't rememer. Did showgirls feature a stripper in her 3rd trimester? Whereas the tagline for Showgirls was "Leave your inhibitions at the door", Bandaids follows up with "... and your guns, knives, nerve gases, babies, peg legs, raptor jesuses, gold crown deodorizers, and herpes." Although I think most in there ignored that last one. So, upon entrance, you are greeted with a very Judge Dredd-like chain-link protected cashier who takes your Abe Lincoln and motions you over to the bar. One thing about strip clubs in general, is, you don't really wanna schooch by anyone ... but at Bandaids, they make this awkward dream a reality for everyone! The walk up to the bar is like cutting to seats 34 and 35 at Giants Stadium. I felt like Tyler Durden contemplating whether to give the vatos the butt or the crotch as they stare blankly at "the talent". Whoa boy. This place has talent like the old Washington Bullets ... but shorter, fatter, and more pregnant. I gave one of my buddies a dollar to snap into one of the monster's string and she gave him a "whusssuuup" that featured her sweet gold grill. To appreciate this, you must know that my friend is quite possibly the sweetest guy on the planet, and gave a friendly "Hi!" to her in return before about-facing to our bistro style table where 8 Coors Lights were posting up our jaws. This was a nice, natural cue for a quick exit, rattled our half-drained beers into the bins and shot out. We couldn't stomach anymore of anything. But wait. On this page you will notice Jason C., and along with the others in our laughter-induced group, came his big mouth. This was his opportunity to mock the sawed-off, convertible, primer-gray Chevy Blazer parked mere feet from the entrance/exit to Bandaids, and although the details are lost as to the specifics, mentioned something about "check out THIS fucking thing!", which was the perfect timing for one of the busted, ghetto-flab strippers to walk out and proceed to angrily say something like "Fuck you. That's mine. What of it?" In response, and generally because he's a giant puss with scary strippers, said something like, "Oh. Its nice. I like it." before shitting himself. I'm sure the rest of the group howling with laughter really set her mind at peace. Anyway. That's the Bandaids story, and you can have one just like it if you give it a chance.
QeBQKXGGHM6B1SynHCZETQ	Food Bakeries Grocery Delis Restaurants 5_star	This place is awesome. The Traditional restaurant as well as the deli style restaurant inside. The assortment of food items is amazing, too many good things to choose from. And the prices are great. It is a great experience, if you like Mexican food you must go and check it out. This is the closest thing to Mexico without being there. After eating it is great to explore the rich colors and products in the market. And don't forget the Sunday brunch with tons of choices and lots of traditional entertainment.
3nIB76o8A-2NlO6GsTjAjw	Food Bakeries Grocery Delis Restaurants 5_star	This place is as exciting as going to Disneyland if you're not used to Hispanic markets! The sights, the smells, the lights, the colors, and the chaos had my head whipping back and forth all evening. We started off with dinner in the cafe inside the market - just $5.99 for 3 street tacos, beans, and rice - and it totally filled me up. I washed it down with a Mexican coke in a glass bottle and it took me back to my childhood to the days before corn syrup became the norm. After eating, we took our time perusing the aisles and examining the foods foreign to us. They have a beautiful produce department and the prices were great on both the more exotic items like fresh papaya's to the staples like tomatoes and lettuce. The meat department is a carnivore's dream come true. Loads of fresh ground beef, pork, and poultry at very fair prices. I had to laugh at the ground pork in the glass case and wish I'd brought my camera. The butcher shaped it into a pig head - complete with a snout - and put cucumber slices for eyes. Not something I'd expect to see at my local gringo Fry's. Shopping here was a real cultural experience tonight and I can't wait to tuck into the treats we brought home!
AQB03ZmfOUe4IJlLY5Zlvg	Food Bakeries Grocery Delis Restaurants 5_star	Hello Ranch Market, nice to finally meet you ! Since moving to my new hood I have fallen in love with this store. They have things I have never seen before anywhere else. I am so overwhelmed when I go here, I am in sensory overload. Mexican bread is 5 for $2, bolillos are 6 for $1, tons of seafood, fresh chorizo ( which I have been eating everyday for a week ), tons of snacks packaged by Ranch Market for super cheap, you can get a meal for 4 people for $10 ( carnitas, rice, beans, tortillas ) and tons of other specialty items. The atmosphere is fun and inviting and everyone is friendly. This store has inspired me to create new dishes at home, like my homemade beans and chorizo. Go here, eat some of their prepared foods that are inexpensive and delicious OR get some fresh ingredients and make something yummy at home. See ya soon Ranch Market.
5rsrQUROtl1KTHAW2ecoLg	Food Bakeries Grocery Delis Restaurants 5_star	Awesome tortilleria and fun to watch with the kidlets. Fresh salsas, frescas, bakery items, meats, and cheeses. Restaurant/cafeteria inside is tasty and you can make your food exactly how you want it (bean and cactus burrito!!). We go here at least once a week to grab our non-organic stuff...kiwis, papayas, mangos, etc. and the tortillas...because they are gigantic! Our bill's never been over $40 for four big bags of produce!
GXKHDG8aXkm2R1kuyl-3Xg	Pet_Services Pet_Stores Pets 5_star	Been going here for years, but just made a big run as we have a new pup. The prices are absolutely terrific.
UTSf2uArSULcbG-r936U0w	Food Donuts 5_star	Great variety, inexpensive and exactly what we wanted on a Sunday morning.
A1UMD3g17UY639b9BRJnnA	Latin_American Salvadoran Restaurants 5_star	I'm going to flat out say this before I start writing the review, my aunt makes the best pupusas. Now with that being said this is a nice little hole in the wall. The place is nice and clean. The food is cheap and delicious. The people are really friendly and the old man behind the register always seems to great me with a smile ( I think he is the owner). Mind you pupusas are more filling then they look so don't over order. I like the traditional queso con loroco. The plantains are also delicious.
-sRqN_--r9QDxoERhg7OoA	Mexican Restaurants 5_star	Been eating here for years and it doesn't disappoint (well, sometimes). I mainly come for the menudo but I also come because of the prices, it's clean and quick service and I know that what I've ordered will be both filling and satisfying. One thing: the salsas are HOT! I cannot eat them out the jar even after all this time. You've been warned:-)
jWh9LZHI1Bc0xqtDJlqvHA	American_(New) Restaurants 5_star	What a great spot. Just moved downtown a month ago and have been exploring new places to eat. Just finished a brunch at Coronado cafe... I had the southwestern omelette, and my fiancé had the crab cakes. First of all the $3 bloody Mary's and mimosas are a steal, but that became an after note to the food! The crab cakes are out of this world, huge chunks of meat and before I could ask for a second bite it was gone. Luckily I had my own omelette that did not disappoint. Cheesy, hatch chilies and really tasty potatoes on the side. The service was good, and the owner was available and really matches the curbside appeal. Great ambiance in a cool historic house. Definitely worth trying.
HWFViA0Op8o-IWUedj96YA	American_(New) Restaurants 5_star	Best crab cake in town? Close second to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse--this is a fantastic little restaurant in downtown Phoenix. Love the family-owned feel.
EJ0BTjzZ2FrGojsWNBrajQ	American_(New) Restaurants 5_star	Hands down, the best date place in central Phoenix. Sadly, I was apparently not on a date and ended up having to pay for our bill BUT in retrospect I was still so damn impressed by this place. Rumor has it that this place is owned by several male flight attendants and when they're not attending flights they are running this restaurant. Leave it to world travelers to produce a classy but quaint but sosticated but understated establishment that can truly please everyone. In true Phoenix fashion, Coronado Cafe was once a house and now stands as a Bistro Cafe. The front porch is now patio seating with cute little tables and bench style sitting all under canopy drapes and string lights. On the inside is the cutest little bar area, very small, but the older gentlemen running the place is so cute and you can tell he really know is cocktails and puts passion into crafting each one. There's also a secluded side patio that's ADORABLE. We ate inside the dining room because the rain (rain, I know... in Phoenix?) started coming down and the wait staff was so attentive and helped us relocate. We were sat in the corner by a window that had its own little garden bed outside. Could not get over this palces cute factor. Tables were small but candle lit and had the presh checker print table clothes, real napkins and honestly one of the best waitresses I've ever had. We order 2 Tequilatinis on Happy Hour and the artichoke dip. This artichoke dip opened the gates of heaven and brought to us the most delightful, out of the ordinary, festive taste I have ever had. It was spicy, but cheesy. It was melty but had good size chunks of artichoke. Simply, cannot go on enough about how good it was. I cannot wait to go back here and have brunch or enjoy the sunset with drinks on the patio. If you're looking for somewhere small and intimate that you'd like to take a significant other or truly impress someone you care about, pelase go here. Everything is perfect for the perfect date.
d5Dq8F987nibcAjKqxHmag	American_(New) Restaurants 5_star	Over a year later I still give this place 5 stars. Their crab cakes are amazing! My boss took me to lunch and I suggested this place. He's from Maryland so he loved that they use Maryland crab. One bit of warning - the bowl of clam chowder is HUGE! It could be a meal by itself. I recommend sharing with a friend or order a cup instead.
2slYyoyphQxksP_AQ_R8Fg	Food Burgers Ice_Cream_&_Frozen_Yogurt Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	McAlpines is one of those old school places that would probably be right at home in downtown Prescott. Authentic, amazing service, and the whole fact that they have an antique store really helped make this place shine. We had a simple dessert that consisted of 2 Phosphorus's and a hot fudge sundae, and after wards, I felt bloated and diabetic. That's because for the prices, you get a surprising amount of deliciousness. You feel like a little kid when your kind, humorous, tattooed server brings you a MASSIVE sundae cup, dripping with hot fudge and all of the toppings. The only, and I mean, THE ONLY drawback, is that I live so far away from them. On the other side, I guess that means I won't be gaining 20 pounds anytime soon.
6FsnwHJLpLC0_t14tgcmmQ	Food Burgers Ice_Cream_&_Frozen_Yogurt Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	I had an excellent ice cream soda and a great sandwich for lunch. The decor/seating was excellent. I felt like i went back in time just walking in. The food and staff were tops! Highly recommended!
fZSoCPzaCrORltcA0U7rQg	Mexican Restaurants 5_star	Eating this Green Chili burro, green chili enchilada style is like winning the lottery 3 times in a row. This has to be one of the greatest food stuff I had ever eaten in my life. Perfect blend of spice and all the other goodness. Even when I burped it up, I wished for chunks to come up so I could re-eat it again. If I could give it 12 stars I would! I need to quit my job and just live in their patio area and eat these until I die. Cash only, open Monday - Friday, 9am - 4pm.
E5G5RFp2zHBgIexk7zbEXQ	Mexican Restaurants 5_star	Best little Mexican place in Phoenix! The chimis and burros and everything I have ever eaten here is amazing! it's in the back of a house in the 'hood, and is worth the trip. If you're going for lunch, getthere before noon to avoid the line that stretches through the neighborhood!
e8xQ6oMoIuG-7hCcS5hx7w	Mexican Restaurants 5_star	I had heard much of the mythical burritos at Rito's. I'd just never passed by it or knew where it was so I always forgot to seek it out. But I am kookoo for cocoa puffs about green chile and had heard this place had the best in town. One day recently, I was driving around the Garfield district looking for a possible new pad as I want to live downtown. I was driving up and down each block looking at rentals that weren't totally sketchy. It's and up and coming area, but it's still a pretty rough neighborhood. As I was driving down 14th st. past a grade school, I spotted people standing in a short line out the door of a converted house with picnic tables outside. A light bulb went on in my head. Aaaah, this must be that place they talk about in the magazines and papers. Rito's! It was 11:30, so I parked, which would probably have been difficult if I'd gotten there 15 mins later. The menu is just burritos and tacos and beans pretty much. There are plaques all over Rito's walls from year after year proclaiming it to be the burrito king of Phoenix. I got a green burro and a side of beans, waited about 5 mins for my order and went out to a picnic table to dine in the sun. I shared a table with some other folks and a pigeon. They are not big on ambiance here. What they lack in that, they make up for in pure, unadulterated burrito kick-assery. The beans, hot as molten lava and a bit soupy, were the most flavorful frijoles I have ever, EVER tasted. The hot sauce, heavy on the oregano, was lovely with good heat for me. The tortilla was thin and chewy with just the right bits of char kissing it. The green chile filling, again a bit more soupy than I'm used to, was just sublime. I couldn't have eaten it without a knife and fork though, cuz it would have oozed all down the front of me. Make sure you ask them for a knife and fork; they don't just put it in the bag. They do take debit cards now, I guess it used to be a cash only business. Boy, am I glad I just happened upon this mythical burrito abode! I felt like I was in one of my friend's Nana's house at a family party. This is down home Mexican food greatness...'nuff said.
fKSwXm0VOuJpwQ5zC8C1RQ	Food Specialty_Food Delis Meat_Shops Restaurants 5_star	Great bacon that they will slice as thick as you like. Sure the ladies begin the counter are old world types. They're friendly enough though and the meats are great. They'll let you try anything you want and if you go in the morning it smells so delicious when they're running the smoker.
1MIKLCPRoqHmgvMZvMRMTw	Seafood Mexican Restaurants 5_star	The food, service and establishment are great Its my all time Mexican Seafood Restaurant in Phoenix. I went with a party of 8 and all ordered different dishes they were all exceptionally delicious. We tried Must try the Camarones Culichis (Shrimp in green sauce topped with jack melted green cheese) Botana de Mariscos (Fresh Seafood served cold), Tortitos de Camaron (Great as an appetizer) and Enchiladas de Camaraon ... ALL were very good ... served with ice cold beers. We will be back next week to try the new menu!
d-nIVxLaL04WUPTytTCJng	Seafood Mexican Restaurants 5_star	Sometimes you have to explore and try those hole in the places. Sometimes you get junk and other times, if your lucky. You get a place like this. I was astounded yes I said it ASTOUNDED. By how authentic and delicious this place is. If you haven't come here you haven't had real Mexican seafood. Trust me you have to come here. Chase out
EPVY7caBeSnTI3Dq5KClXQ	Seafood Mexican Restaurants 5_star	The best burrito I have had in a long time and the service was great. They gave us a complimentary ceviche tostada and it was yummy.
ElgnMwBL1MJC3oSdgRdjLA	Seafood Mexican Restaurants 5_star	Micheladas with Dos X on tap with a dozen oysters on the side? GAME OVER! This place is the best of the best when it comes up to mariscos.
Q37uXbfuizkC0FcCpRtqOg	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	The Desert Botanical Gardens are not what you think.... Yes, there are innumerable cacti of every shape and type as well as a great many other plants and even the occasional critter ranging from birds and lizards to jackrabbits. Forget all these things because for a great many of you they are only going to offer a very scenic well cultivated backdrop to some wonderful events that the garden hosts including Jazz in the Garden (Fridays March - May), Agave on the Rocks, The Chile and Chocolate Festival, Luminarias (December), and a host of other events and concerts that are extremely well done. If your looking for a special night or event that blends natural serenity and entertainment into an exquisitely unified package then check out the special events on the Desert Botanical Garden website www.dbg.org (and yes there is booze).
ez5iaHm74ixXUV2xBenJ6Q	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	I visited the Desert Botanical Gardens on Valentine's Day to see the Chihuly blown glass exhibit. One word to describe it: incredible! The pieces are mixed throughout the desert displays which had our group constantly questioning whether any of the pieces were possibly custom made for this specific location. There were two canoe/boat structures, one that housed beautiful colored spheres (kind of looked like giant marbles), and the other that housed pumpkin-shaped pieces mixed with other strangely shaped pieces. I absolutely recommend that you visit this exhibit at night (I think it closes down at 8) as all of the pieces are lit up which really shows off the vibrancy of the colors. I'm not sure how long this display will be set up, but you definitely don't want to miss it! There were tons of photographers working while we were there, so that was slightly annoying, but I can see why they were all trying to take so many pictures. Some of the pieces are absolutely breathtaking. Go!
t-Kq9-8Ka2sjARfPY4II1Q	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	We visited just to see the Chihuly exhibit. The traveling display had been to Phipps Conservatory in Pittsburgh and I thought was would be great to see it in the desert. It was more amazing than I could have imagined. First off, I did not realize that there were so many different types and species of cactus. I wish I was a local, because I would love to be able to sign up for their Desert Landscaper School. That would be amazing!! The lay out and the trails are very nice. And I can't believe that I am typing this, but the different types of cactus are so beautiful!! I must have taken a gajillion photos! Also, we happened to go just before sunset, so it was very nice to wander around the gardens after dark. Plus, the Chilly glass looks amazing all lit up. A must see in Phoenix!
a3XPDsQBqx63E-t6lSqkvA	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	I love taking out of town guests here. It is so beautiful, especially at sunset. I've also been during the Chihuly exhibit (AMAZING), Butterfly exhibit (Pretty Cool) and the Chili and Chocolate Festival (So Fun and Yummy)! Definitely a trip you'll enjoy!
5srv0NAFH_23t4ANv0BYPQ	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	Wonderful! Hailing from the Midwest, I've always loved desert flora and fauna because it's so radically different from what I grew up with. A few hours at the Desert Botanical Garden really indulged my fascination. Grab a sunhat, a camera and set aside a few hours to wander the trails here. It's truly a delightful experience. Besides all the amazing plantlife, I saw myriad birds, a lizard, a jackrabbit and some other kind of tree rodent thing, though I sadly did not catch a glimpse of desert tortoise. I guess I'll just have to go back!
49HuEVNDthJsM9yC67ZKsw	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	Such a beautiful place to see the desert! Phoenix has really sprawled since I initially moved here in the late 70s. It's quite a drive to get out to the desert today -- but the DBG is close in, well laid out and has so many great events. I became a member in the first week I related back to Phoenix and intend to visit very often. Great for locals; great for visitors.
36FYiO4bJ2JT9t_233fWsg	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	When I want to go out but not spend $100 on entertainment and also get some exercise in at the same time and see some beautiful Arizona landscape, the Desert Botanical Gardens is the best place I can go. I enjoy walking around the Garden looking at all of the flowers in bloom and all of the different kinds of cactus. I also enjoy when they have different exhibits that you can see as you are wandering the garden. I really enjoyed the Chihuly Glass artwork that was displayed a few years back. Probably my favorite time of the year to come here is when they have the butterflies. They are so pretty and this year there were so many of them! We went this last weekend on my day off and the weather was perfect and we just had a great time. I also get to brush up on my photography skills here the best because I can take some amazing pictures of flowers and butterflies. If you want to see what the Arizona desert is all about, you need to come here to experience it first hand. Its not only about dirt and cacti. There are flowers galore as well.
EeDD5o89JSLzyuybPbBd0Q	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	The Desert Botanical Garden is hands down the greatest place to get away in the city. 5 reasons you need to become a member. 1. The beauty of our Desert Landscape. The park is so well laid out with numerous spots to sit and relax whether under a cactus or mesquite tree or by one of the numerous water features thru out the park. 2. The Fall concert series. The Garden brings in great musicians at night under the stars in the cool Phoenix air. Enjoy a bottle of wine, Spanish guitar and nibble on the catered Arcadia Farms. We have so much fun at these events and try to make as many as we can. 3. Dia de los muertos. Another great event held at the Gardens. We had a blast as the Gardens goes all out celebrating the day of the dead. Amazing food, local artist, theater and the final procession. 4. Chocolate and Chili Festival. Yes, they go great together. Tons of Chocolatiers and music. A must for any chocolate lover. 5. The Luminaries (Holidays). Had the greatest Christmas memories enjoying the large number of musical groups and beautifully lit luminaries (Yes with candles, don't know how long it takes to light those). This will get you in the Christmas/Holiday mood. The Desert Botanical Gardens takes the beauty of the harsh desert environment and turns it into an oasis filled with music, spirits, food and light. We will be members for as long as we live here.
e7wBCQTHMRePI040jIha6Q	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	Always fun for the entire family, and they especially have great seasonal events, like Luminarias.
h9lt2cXREX3_MwoeQYeSqQ	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	Kinda spendy, but a very nice way to kill an afternoon.
WLDtwLnSwGd9KSBd2FLpUA	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	The Butterfly Exhibit was worth the trip.
aHEByZ1dia5YBythdUBEyw	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	I love this place. Everyone needs to go here and they will love it too. Photographers - they have classes you can take where you have access to the garden at night. What's more awesome than a picture of the full moon with a mighty saguaro in front of it. They also have smart phone photography classes. If you don't need a class, there is so much to photograph here. I've captured amazing shots of hummingbirds, flowers, butterflies, art, and people just to name a few. An awesome place to practice your craft. The events - There is something always going on. Luminaries, Music in the Garden, Pumpkin Festival, Chocolates and Chiles, Dia de Los Muertos, giant art installations, plant sales, and these are just a few that happen in the fall. If you had a membership, it could be paid back in unique visits within a couple weeks. Classes - I already talked about the photography classes (those are the ones I've taken) but there are so many others! You want to learn how to garden? Maybe create a drip system? Blow glass? Practice Tai-Chi? Seriously you can do all of this in the most picturesque place Phoenix has to offer. I'm a huge fan of the garden and recently joined their Monarch Society that includes membership to the garden and has extra special events for young professionals. That means enjoying everything awesome the garden has to offer with other awesome people. They are in the process of building a restaurant there which I am so looking forward to dining at. What a great location for drinks and fresh local food. If you think it's just walking around looking at cactus, think again.
u1mPMgiV88CsIpN5s0Q3Zw	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	Attended last weekend for the Cactus and Corks event. I'm from Ohio and live in CO so this was an awesome place to check out the deserts terrain. I recommend keeping an eye for for local events and bringing any out of town guests to this garden. Beautiful. Well worth my afternoon
fEb9Qqblag2fvh1Vvvr24g	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	I have visited this locale on a few occasions now and I must say there is nothing like it in all the Valley and perhaps the state itself. They host tons of events throughout the year and the YELP party that was held here in 2010 was EPIC. I highly recommend going at night....but watch for the critters.....LOL...both animal and human....LOL. There doesn't have to be an event there to go visit though....if you just want some peace and quiet....enjoy a beautiful sunrise or sunset.....or just take a romantic stroll with that special someone.....then this is your place. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!
rcrWvG4lBEd0BibsgvnwOQ	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	This place is beautiful. We had a BOGO coupon, and I had my student ID so we saved about $36. The bathrooms are clean and the water fountains are filtered with cold water. Makes walking around on a hot day much more enjoyable. If you have the opportunity to come later in the day I would recommend it. They have lights throughout the grounds and it's really fun for the kids to see. It's not a very big garden, but it was fun to sit on the lounge chairs by the water foutains and just relax. Before we knew it, 30 mins had passed by. They offer a variety of classes for an additional fee. I'm sure it would be fun to go to. I believe it's free on the second Tuesday of every month, so it's a great opportunity to take the kids when they get of of school.
jmNZ-CVef2MGqoWZwjQpng	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	When on vacation the wife and I always try to do something new. Though we have already visited DBG previously we were excited to see the Chihuly exhibit and the Luminarias. It was so worth it. Seeing this at night while the sun is setting is absolutely a sight to see. Though the Luminarias only run during the holiday season I highly recommend seeing this place at night. There just a peaceful feeling about walking around in the dark and discovering new things around each corner, be it a musical group (they had four last night), or a gorgeous blown glass art exhibit lit up and complimenting the plant life around it. Last night put us into the holiday spirit. It is a definite must see. For some reason last night there was a special on admission. 50% off, only $15 a person. But even at $30 it is well worth the price. Happy Holidays to all. Ho Ho Ho. :)
df7AYgLzaSgzI8EbuLbqsw	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	Every time I visit the Desert Botanical Garden, I kick myself for not visiting more often. It's usually one of their amazing annual events that pulls me in - Luminarias, Chiles and Chocolates, or some other special exhibit - but there is so much to see and explore and learn in this garden, even when there isn't a special event going on. The collection of plants is extensive and impressive, the way it's organize and displayed throughout the garden makes turning every corner an adventure, and their dedication to showing off the beauty of the desert is enough to make any Phoenician proud. If you are a photographer, this is one of the best places in Phoenix you can go for a wide variety of photo opportunities, any time of day and any time of year. Whatever you're interests may be, for out-of-town visitors this should be at the top of your list of attractions to experience, and for locals you should make it a habit of visiting at least once per year.
48F3JcqRKhKnei9hCO3NyQ	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	Fantastic place to bring a date or out-of-towners to experience the beauty of the desert landscape. It does get quite hot and there is little shade so I recommend wearing a hat and sunblock. I've been here a few times, and it's a 2 to 3 hour outing to explore max. The Chihuly exhibit is very cool and definitely worth checking out, though the garden was the most crowded I've ever experienced when we went even though they sell a limited number of tickets for specific time slots. The local libraries offer "culture passes" where you can get free admission to the garden, and AAA membership gives you a 20% discount.
45rDGODDNVK_Q8y1l9uTwQ	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	The Chihuly Exhibit was simply beautiful and amazing! I have never seen anything like it. Thank you for the opportunity to see such great beauty!
Efd4bBjkkTybxrG5_yt9zA	Arts_&_Entertainment Music_Venues Parks Nightlife Active_Life Botanical_Gardens 5_star	As soon as I found out that the Desert Botanical Gardens had a Dale Chihuly exhibit I knew that I had to go. Honestly, if it weren't for the Chihuly exhibit I probably would have never gone to the garden but I'm so glad that I went. The garden in the spring was absolutely beautiful. Displaying desert plants from the Sonoran Desert in the Southwestern United States and around the world. Many of the plants in bloom at the time that I went. Although it was spring and the temperature was tolerable I can't imagine taking a stroll through the gardens during the sweltering summer days. There isn't too much shade along the paths. The employees were really friendly and very informative. I also really appreciated the fact that the gardens were so well maintained. Parking is free. Adult tickets are $22 and Students $12. Unfortunately, I believe the Chihuly exhibit has ended but don't let that stop you from checking out this beautiful gem. Would definitely drop by the gardens if I'm ever in the Phoenix area again. I loved it! Don't forget to bring your hat, water, and some sunscreen!

nx_etjY02SPnQ0KeEHvjyg	Local_Services Shopping Mobile_Phones Electronics_Repair 5_star	Went back again today, to the new location and was so thankful that they were still around. He was able to fix my Blackberry Curve in less than 5 minutes. He was helping out some poor guy who washed his RAZR in the washing machine. He spent time explaining the new phone to the gentleman and charged him a very reasonable rate for a new phone, getting the number on to that phone, and providing a wall and phone charger. I was impressed!
UXisWxd-6JfC3Nh_QEomJA	Auto_Repair Automotive Auto_Parts_&_Supplies Oil_Change_Stations 5_star	7 years and 30+ visits with several different vehicles and only one mistake that was corrected immediately. These guys are always fair, have the best work ethic and never have a problem explaining everything in detail. I now live 35 miles away, but still drive back there to get any work done. FYI; they can tow you in if you need it.
HI5oJPtUX8tywFflgaCoaQ	Active_Life Zoos 5_star	The Phoenix Zoo is my favorite place to spend beautiful spring Phoenix days. My 5 year old daughter and I love the sting rays, the petting zoo, the water play areas, the carousel, the tree house, the horse back riding classes ... this place has so much to offer. My personal favorite exhibit is the Savannah and the new Komodo dragon exhibit is cool too. The membership is worth the money and pays for itself after just a couple of trips. You also get free passes and discounts as part of the membership so I definitely recommend it. Once you go there, you will find that you want to go back time and again to play, explore and hang-out.
iw0VauEWrrwK8lCuVTDk0w	Active_Life Zoos 5_star	What a great place to take the kids for a fun day! Camel rides, petting zoo, great play areas. It's not the San Diego Zoo, but it's not to shabby...
cUN41qW_JLek9jHkXLrxfA	Active_Life Zoos 5_star	The Phoenix Zoo is tucked away in Papago Park. Just look for some hills that remind you of Disneyland's Big Thunder Mountain and you've found it. It seems Phoenix could do a better job directing traffic to this little gem. I never saw one sign until we arrived, basically. It's a great oasis for all ages. Little kids can fall in love with all sorts of animals while older kids can get a thrill from the zipline ride. There are so many snack options including: popcorn, ice cream, frozen lemonade and more. Plus there are lots of water attractions or the little kids like a little river under a tree playhouse and a water pad area. There were a lot more things to see then we saw so you could spend hours there. Don't forget to get a family portrait while you're there, too. They photoshop animals into some of the poses so it looks like your kids are holding a lion cub or other wildlife. We only stayed a few hot hours there but, I would recommend it to anyone visiting the Phoenix area. Very nice indeed.
jcWXff6Z89XSk3jv5DUwHA	Active_Life Zoos 5_star	By far the best zoo in the valley. The year passes are great and pay for themselves. Plenty of shade and places to sit and rest, especially in the AZ sun.
MI6ZWespJrfv6u_LRkXukg	Active_Life Zoos 5_star	One of the best presents I got was a zoo membership. I have always loved the Phoenix Zoo for their conservation efforts, helping save animals from extinction, and making constant improvements on the facilities for both their animals and their guests. A.A. Milne once wrote, ""There are some people who begin the Zoo at the beginning, called WAYIN, and walk as quickly as they can past every cage until they get to the one called WAYOUT, but the nicest people go straight to the animal they love the most, and stay there." Once you've walked through the Phoenix Zoo, you'll feel the same way as you find your favorite animals you just have to visit over and over again. The membership is worth it, because you can't just visit once. If you can, try to take advantage of the early member hours during the warmer months. This way, you won't tire out as fast and you can see the animals when they are out and about.

ru4Qv1uU7RCCAr7c4TvgCg	Hotels_&_Travel Event_Planning_&_Services Hotels 5_star	Went to a job fair here. Very nice place. Friendly employees and people. Well put together conference room and lots of water and snacks for everyone. There was also candy but since I have braces, I stuck with the water. The day I was here it was very rainy so running to and from my car that day was very wet but it didn't take anything away from the experience .
vbucH0h5X9i-6JmXtwAakg	Auto_Repair Automotive 5_star	Need a good auto repair place, this is it. I have been using Terry's for over 8 years. I was introduced to Terry's Auto by a friend. Since that time, I have used this place exclusively for my cars. It is very tough to find an auto mechanic that you can trust. With Terry's, I drop my car off, tell them what I need and walk out. I come back, usually by the end of the day, and he is done. Fair price without a worry. Have been taking my wifes 1997 Chrysler there for years. Have had new transmission, new sets of tires, and multiple other basic maintenance. A vehicle that probably would not have lasted more than 100k miles is still running well at 150k plus miles. Terry has even been kind enough to work with me on payments when I had transmission installed. Can't promise he will do the same with you, but then, I have been going to him for 8 years. Need a good mechanic, look no further...
Wvgwc-lqJvXlZdp6fFGQ4w	Mexican Restaurants 5_star	Los Jarritos has fallen on hard times, the good news is they are still open the bad is that it's Wed-Thurs-Fri. They've been closed for the past 4 months as business was slow. Still great food, some of the best salsa, enchilada sauce, and machaca in town. Rosa, the owner and wait staff, and her mother Maria, the cook, plan to be open 5 days a week in Dec. Sure glad I got my Las Jarritos fix after a long wait.
dV429YY4pN1LJV8hQzA4Yg	Auto_Repair Automotive 5_star	We have traditionally taken our vehicles strictly to the dealerships for any type of repairs. Recently my wife found a coupon for Dean's in the ValuPak. She convinced me to give them a try and we are glad we did. She celled them to talk about to schedule an appointment. When she got off the phone she just couldn't stop raving about their customer service. That was just the first call. The following day we dropped the car off to them 15 minutes before they opened for the day. Again, great customer service. The great customer service just kept consistent through our entire experience. Their quality of work has been great and they don't try to push repairs on you. I didn't use it, but I understand that they offer a shuttle service. Since writing this review I have received a phone call from them making sure that I was satisfied with their service and received a thank you card in the mail. They continue to impress me. When was the last time you got that level of service from anyone?
c7atsaUnYA72i0HFfnbnmw	Auto_Repair Automotive 5_star	I have complete confidence with this shop. Super knowledgeable and were quick and friendly. I took my truck to them for a second opinion and they found that the "recommendations" from the other shop were completely untrue. I saved over $700 by having them do the work and not the first overpriced shop.
MXUHSkHQC_2nBnIGmsdOKw	Active_Life Golf 5_star	Papago has long been arguably my favorite course in town, but it took me a long time to finally get out there for the first time since the renovation. I've played it many times pre-renovation and was excited to finally play the "new" Papago. Once I got past the first couple holes, I realized most of the course really hasn't changed too much. Most of the noticeable changes are on #1 and #9 since so many trees are gone, the ugly pond by the old #1 tee is no more, and the lake between those two holes is cleaned up and reshaped. #1 is tougher now and I don't see myself hitting it in two anymore, but I love the way it looks with the lake cleaned up. #2 is nicer without all the dead trees around the green which allows for the clear view of the buttes. #9 benefited the most from the changes in my opinion. It's a beautiful view from the tee and the drive is no longer partially blind from the tips. The entire hole is in view, and it looks great. Not sure I like the way #11 was changed. I like the cleaner view and the cleaned up lake, but it's a small green for a 190 yard tee shot all over water. I think they should of kept that hole the same distance and let that small, sloping, firm green be all the challenge you need there. The greens are huge now and they are firm and fast, but still roll great. They pose quite a challenge as shown in all my failed up-and-downs today, but it's a fair challenge. Big props for the updated bathroom and the water and ice machine at the intersection of 5-6-11-12. LOVE the water and ice machine. You got fancy on me, Papago. The pro shop and snack bar are in a trailer right now, and I don't know the status of the new clubhouse, but I have a feeling that it's a long way off due to the city budget issues. It still works for a muni, but don't expect resort-style amenities. So all in all, I still love Papago and it's still arguably my favorite course and the best layout in the valley. The greens are a challenge but in a good way. The prices are higher now but still reasonable with the City of Phoenix discount golf card. If you're an out-of-towner, I'd say Papago is definitely a must-play, but the non-cardholder rates can be a little steep. Did I mention I love the new water and ice machine out on the course?
MoMAGGNJpgnyz0PWO81KZw	Shopping_Centers Shopping Outlet_Stores Chinese Restaurants 5_star	It's unique and it's in Phoenix, for that alone it gets 5 stars. This is a fun place to kill a couple of hours with out of town visitors or on a date. Stroll through the gardens. Wander through the grocery store, (yes it stinks but it's part of the ambiance) and look a all the strange and gross foods. Try one of the restaurants, but not Quizno's that doesn't count. Check out the curio shops for some odd trinket to take home with you.

This has been to only sub shop I have ever enjoyed. Their Blimpie Best should be an award winner. Also, the customer service at this location is phenomenal! They are so we welcoming and kind. This will be my regular location for now on!
ULwAqMEEyi9o5TrY9QT3VQ	Food Specialty_Food Beer,_Wine_&_Spirits 5_star	This is the store we shopped when we lived up the street. I like the size of the store, unlike other stores this size such as Trader Joes which drives me crazy. I really liked the choice of veggies since there is nothing better than a good salad or side dish. The meat counter has a great selection of meats and fish along with a few products put together for you and just cook. If I could not find somethng they often would order it for me and that was wonderful. Good cheese selection too is great. One thnig I did not usually enjoy was the pastry, it looks great but little flavour. And as for the prepared food counter, I looked often and thought it looks great but never bought anything. I preferred to cook. But most of all this store is always so well kept and organized with very helpful employees.
SfSCpM0WMcu_vRR-2rknOg	Food Specialty_Food Beer,_Wine_&_Spirits 5_star	This is a smaller, older, happier Aj's. A go-to spot for produce if you can't get to the CenPho downtown market or the Guadeloupe Farmer's Market. Very helpful and unpretentious service for wine and liquor. Good for pizza-by-the-slice (I like the veggie). Hot tip: Flowers are half-off from 4:00 to 6:00 on Friday. They have some really cool single-stems, so you could do something snazzy on the cheap. Fun fact: Chris Bianco used to make pizzas here in the late '80s, when the store was called Euromarket. Talk about nostalgia -- you could grab a Bianco pizza and eat outside with only a ten minute wait!
4nDHgsfi-tUY8i3qQ2lCtQ	Pizza Italian Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	These sandwiches are the bomb. You will not be disappointed.
7rQ72CwOrwqAK6aFD6awOQ	Pizza Italian Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	I of course have a crush on Chris Bianco. Not because of his rugged good looks or what could be hiding behind his fly but because of his ideals and passions. He is committed to the finest ingredients.. the best techniques and has the knowledge to pull it all together almost daily with consistency. I admire what he does and it simply shows in all that he makes. PB for me is hands down the best place in town for a great rustic sandwich. The flavors and textures are simple yet when combined offer a complexity that's hard to beat. Down to earth this place directly reflects the passion of it's owner. Chris Bianco should run for president.. no bs.. no lying about WMD.. just true and real, honest to goodness.
j4aX57yJ6ljaVVK-bDG-tA	Pizza Italian Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	The best sandwich I've ever had is hands down Chris Bianco's amazing housemade mozzarella, local tomato and basil sandwich. All his sandwiches are delivered on amazing pane (Italian bread) with ingredients of the highest quality - as at Pizzeria Bianco. If I stop by with less hunger I usually go for the house made focaccia, the pieces are large enough to practically be considered a slice of deep dish pizza. They're topped with a different combination daily and are heated in the wood fired oven before being wrapped up - it's amazing for half the price of the sandwich. Be warned that seating is only outdoors, but the tables are covered by shade with water misters. So depending on the weather this usually isn't that big of a deal. And if you are really brave you may venture next door into Lux for a cool drink and an escape from the outdoor tables. This is a wonderful spot for a casual lunch or for bringing people from out of town. The lines are not nearly as long as they are at Pizzeria Bianco.... yet.
5YIUTztLfxaBCA5NG0QZvg	Pizza Italian Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	Excellent fresh sandwiches to give you a break from the monotony of work. Makes a good business meeting lunch as well. And now you can sit in the cool air-conditioning next door if you get there early enough.
-zvNsZQ9GYxtKJ-5bEOE2A	Pizza Italian Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	I dream about Pane Bianco's rustic loaves. On a weekend trip to Arizona I stumbled upon this joint. I bought a loaf of bread and gobbled it down in minutes. The next day I returned for another loaf. I couldn't get enough. The bread: perfectly salty, with a crunchy crust, and fluffy crumb. I am now hunting for a comparable loaf in my hometown, Los Angeles.
Nd-1aP-Ll95cmjeR3jA7_Q	Pizza Italian Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	Small and tasteful menu, nice decor, welcoming staff, great beer!
xrNpLeaWngX8tWZwrvaZUw	Pizza Italian Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	Have never had a bad sandwich here. The bread is baked fresh in a brick oven on the premises by Super Mario and Luigi. The mozzarella cheese is fresh, soft and mild. I love the mozzarella sandwich; it's on the daily menu. But I would go adventurous and get the market sandwich for the day. It's always different but I have never been disappointed. They now also give you a tasty cold bean salad when you order a sandwich. Strong onion flavor but a nice touch with the mozzarella sandwich. A sandwich from here and tropical iced tea from Lux next door make for a meal for the gods. They only serve sandwiches to go until 4pm. But you can enjoy the nice French, Bohemian chic dining area if you want a nice dinner.
aF3b8AytnNHosXGfc1T12A	Pizza Italian Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	My husband and I went to Pane Bianco when we were driving through Phoenix and we absolutely loved it! Incredible food, service and decor. Pane Bianco had a very warm and friendly vibe. The bread is to die for!
ewMW0Eopo9uBtAh6vJRdPw	Pizza Italian Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	I've only eaten at the restaurant once and have ordered takeout from here numerous time as I live about a block away. Dine-in experience: I came here with a friend who raved about this place. I loved the restaurance. The atmosphere is low-key and romantic. The service is great, casual while still being professional and the food. Well It's owned by Chris Bianco (in some form or another at least) so do I really need to talk about how great the food is? Well if you're unfamiliar, the food is incredible! Take-out experience: I love that when I order something to go they know exactly how long it will take to be ready. It means I am not made to sit and wait while my food is being prepared and at the same time it means my food isn't sitting waiting for me to get there (their pizzas are paper thin and get lose heat quickly). The staff is always friendly and personable. I love that I can buy alive oils and maranara sauce there too. I'm going to try my hand at making pizza this weekend. I bought some pizza flour, maranara and oil from them yesterday.
y6Re68aSE9MdP0W6IV1w4Q	Pizza Italian Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	I have eaten almost everything on Pane Bianco's menu! Their market sandwiches never disappoint; the flavors in the slow roasted pork are crazy good, the mozarella sooo fresh, you feel like thanking the cow. My favorite pizza is a tie between the rosa and bianco verde - 2 entirely different pizza experiences. One features pistachios and caramelized onion(rosa) and the other, arugula atop amazing cheese. Both put me in an exceptionally good mood and I relish every single biteI have no idea how they make everything so delicious but keep the magic going! An added plus? The rice pudding is unbelievable and the hospitality they show their customers sets the bar! Every star, well deserved! These people have my respect!
aAtrZoXr2SJuZQiXmtxIgQ	Pubs Bars Nightlife British Restaurants 5_star	Okay... the bad reviewers must have gone to another bar or something. If you are looking for table clothes or elegant atmosphere, why go to a bar? I have had great luck here. This place is everything that I would expect an English pub to be. They have many beers (an amazing amount) and when I went there, I had a waitress remember me and my drink order from about 3 weeks prior. Make no mistake, this is a PUB! It is not fine dining! It is a local bar where you can let your hair down and relax! The atmosphere is great and the girls are pretty, both customers and wait staff! The food is great pub food! What more could anyone want from a bar? I haven't been disappointed yet, and I have been going there for at least 2 years. It isn't perfect... it's a bar. I'm looking to sit with my friends, have great conversation, drink a beer, eat good food, and look at girls. Isn't that what a bar is for? If that is what you are interested in, George and Dragon is the perfect place!
P3U6jUwJ0Ii4JbFvW8_yhw	Sporting_Goods Bikes Shopping 5_star	I recently purchased by first road bike from Eric, the owner of Slippery Pig. The service was and continues to be superb. I got a really great deal on the bike as well as all the "fixings" like a computer, headlight, shoes, pedals, extra tubes, etc. Eric even took the time to give me a mini lesson on how to fix a flat/replace a tube and how to adjust the clips on my shoes (after he took the time to secure them in for me in the first place). This was not because his bike shop was quiet and there wasn't any other work to do...this is because that is just the kind of guy he is and the type of bike shop he runs. You might have to wait a while to get help when its busy but they're gonna take good care of you when they do. The guys are a laid back group who love to shoot the shit and talk about bikes, recent rides, and old battle-scars. Any time my bike needs a tune up or adjustment they are happy to help. They made sure the bike fit my frame well and made minor adjustments to the seat height, handle bar angle, etc. Things I would not be able to do for myself as a novice rider. Furthermore, as a new rider the guys are even encouraging me to ride with a group and I've been invited to join them on many rides. There are some negative reviews but I would disregard them. I would gladly buy another bike here and I have many friends who have been loyal to this shop for many, many years and have purchased dozens of bikes from Eric. The new shop is in a great location across from the light-rail on Central ave. Plus there is a new, adorable shop-puppy working there!
Je4MGN3YgZm74rdl7OvgEA	Sporting_Goods Bikes Shopping 5_star	I have been to slippery pig a half a dozen times in the last few months since moving in nearby. I have nothing but great things to say about the shop. They are friendly and courteous and I haven't experienced any of that bike snobbery that comes with LBS.

Qr4vBoPJ4-MUMvYixPKRzA	Doctors Health_&_Medical 5_star	First of all, THE LOCATION HAS CHANGED. I followed Yelp's directions because I'm a tool and didn't look up the actual address online... yup, they're no longer at 333 E. Osborn. They're at 1313 E. Osborn. So... yeah. That aside, o-m-g. For a doctor of this sort, Dr. Cyr is AMAZING. I have been to many women gynos (sorry, no dudes up in my lady-business) and I've had good ones and I've had atrocious ones. My atrocious experiences have all been in Phoenix, so I had been without an ob-gyn for several months until a co-worker recommended Dr. Cyr. Lucky for me, I struck GOLD! Dr. Cyr, you're not allowed to retire. Sorry. (Don't worry, she's young; she won't retire anytime soon). Cut to the chase. Reasons why Dr. Cyr is amazing: 1) She doesn't make me feel like a creepy weirdo for not being married nor wanting kids anytime soon. SERIOUSLY, I got grief from ob-gyns for 'not being ready for a family yet.' Um, guys, I can't even feed myself on a regular basis, and you want me to have a kid? Major fail. Dr. Cyr DOES NOT DO THIS. She didn't even bring up me wanting kids now or in the future. Thanks, Dr. Cyr! 2) I didn't wait a million hours to see her! At my last gyno doctor (who shall remain nameless), I waited 2 hours for my appt. Wtf?? Here, I waited no more than 20 minutes, and that was because I was filling out paperwork. YAY! 3) Dr. Cyr answered my questions professionally and fully. She didn't shirk around my more... awkward... questions, and she explained the options to me in plain English. She reassured me on some things that I was worried about, and she even made me laugh in the process. I NEVER laugh at the doctors! This is amazing!! On a less quantifiable basis, I felt Dr. Cyr just 'got' me. It's hard to explain, but I felt comfortable talking to her and felt I could bring any issue up and she wouldn't judge me for it. Shoot, I think I want to have a baby with Dr. Cyr now. Wait.. that's not quite what I meant... anyway, go see Dr. Cyr if you have lady-parts! You won't regret it!
orsH4MWjzw9IeKq6FzaF_g	Hospitals Medical_Centers Health_&_Medical 5_star	I absolutely love this hospital. Having been to several other military hospitals, this one has made most everything a breeze in comparison. Also when I tend my friends the things that happen during doctor's visits and the attention I receive from the doctor they are envious. Granted not all the doctor's here are exceptional, some seem to be and act like your a typical HMO doctor who doesn't care about their patient. Dr. Azhar though will actually discuss what she thinks the problem is, and if you offer an opinion on what you might think is causing it that differs from hers she will actually not only listen, but discuss why or why you may not be right and if it might be what you think do follow-up to help determine it. Really?!? how many doctors do that now days?? The catch is appointments may not always start on time, but who cares if that means patients are getting individual attention and get more than 2 minutes of the doctor's attention!

vxUUysiz14tenl9HWwUU9w	Delis Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	I just re-visited Cheese 'N Stuff this weekend after a while. I guess just eat during their limited hours very often. They close very early (4pm). I love their liverwurst sandwiches and the Bismark but this time I decided to try the Doughboy people speak of minus mayo as I do not enjoy warm sandwich lubrication. As ever the place is tiny, homey and spotlessly clean. I had some of the hot German Potato salad as a side and a ginger ale. All were yummy, delicious and satisfying! As I was eating I had a yen for a Celery Soda to go with this classic sandwich but I've only been able to get them at Chompie's in the valley. There are loads of interesting European cookies to get packages of as dessert so grab a couple of friends when you go but carpool as the lot is smallish. I guess they stopped giving pickles with sandwiches, bummer.

Or, of course, they can create one for you... and they are gorgeous, dense arrangements that last weeks and weeks. The shop is always decorated so creatively, it always inspires me! Every first friday you can stop by (for no cost) and learn how to arrange flowers. I love this place!
EMmJlCT7fqVAmoCKnp9zhw	Music_&_DVDs Books,_Mags,_Music_&_Video Shopping 5_star	RIP, Mr. Wax. I read in New Times that Dennis, the long time owner of Tracks in Wax, recently passed. For now, the plan is the store will go on without him. I'm quietly optimistic - but will miss his sense of humor and encyclopaedic music knowledge. Last time I was in with a girlfriend, we ended up wrestling over Sisters Of Mercy's "First and Last and Always." She won, but promised me visitation rights. (Bitch doesn't even have a record player!!) Sorry, I digress. I walked out with (get your collective geek squeals in unison) the original 2 record set of the radio broadcast of Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds." Granted, it's not music - but SQUEE! I can't wait to play it on a dark and stormy night! It was a geektacular moment in my life, to be sure! Selection is solid - but keeping in mind it's used music - what's hard to find is still hard to find. Dennis told me he coulnd't keep Leonard Cohen or Tom Waits in stock no matter how much he brought in. Damn other record collectors that get there wanting the same things I do! I really hope Tracks in Wax continues - it's a special and magical place.
mxCxFgEOBvGCoBLPlTiWmA	Music_&_DVDs Books,_Mags,_Music_&_Video Shopping 5_star	Tracks In Wax has been a landmark here in Phoenix, and it was just today that I found out of Dennis' passing. I spent many a day hanging out in this store when I was went to high school down the road. Admittedly, most of the time I chose hanging out at Tracks instead of making my mid morning English class. I learned a majority of my early music knowledge thanks to those many days at Tracks. Stopped in today, filled with nostalgia and didn't leave empty handed. RIP Dennis.
82NLY5hTu-e_YNpTjcLLFA	Music_&_DVDs Books,_Mags,_Music_&_Video Shopping 5_star	this was my last stop on my Phoenix vinyl ventures. It was actually supposed to be my 2nd stop, but they close too early at 6pm, so I got there too late the first time. I was able to get here at 530 and felt bad since the lady stayed around till 615pm for me.-----I could have spent at least another 45 mins here. I didn't realize that they kept an Indie section up front, so after spending most of my time finding just a few items in the regular section, I found my section, but right at closing time. As I have pretty much most of what I want on UK vinyl, I now mostly collect Japanese vinyl releases----this place had a pretty good stock of nice Japanese pressings of the stuff I like. Pricing was on the higher side, most of my Japanese scores were $20 and up. They had some killer 7' vinyl, like rare Cure singles, but they were way over-priced i ended up spending the most dough here, even though my best finds were at Revolver
NPkIe-bUgUAWj0jIp-_T7g	Vegetarian Buffets Salad Restaurants 5_star	The thing i like about this place is the selection and it is all very fresh! The coupons really help as well. It is always very clean here,the kitchen and dining area. So no problem there. Soup is fantastic and if you can't find what you like ,then you are very picky. Something new that they have started is charging for special toppings. Which can really up your bill. But, other than that, you cannot beat the choices. Bathrooms are somewhat clean. I am sure it is hard to deep up with it all the time. Lots of parking in the lot.
Pk28awY5CDrSjXKlyqGYJA	Vegetarian Buffets Salad Restaurants 5_star	Everything is super fresh whenever we go. Easy to fill a plate with healthy, delicious salad, but hard not to overheat! Their chili is also very tasty. We always try to eat there when we are in Phoenix.

I have had all of the barbers cut my hair, but I prefer to use Abrahigm or Roman. Previously, Roman's dad, Boris, was also excellent. I have never had to wait more than one person to get one of those guys, and usually get to sit down in one of their chairs as soon as I walk though the door. The cut and the hot towel and massage are all so relaxing. I have also had several shaves there as part of my service. Closer shave than I can ever give myself, and you'd never believe how relaxing it is to have a guy with a sharp blade that close to the jugular! I always leave there knowing that I couldn't have had better service anywhere else. I would recommend it to everybody!

Ja30MYoVYG6SLHDqQ9jWGw	Pet_Services Pet_Groomers Veterinarians Pet_Boarding/Pet_Sitting Pets 5_star	The doctors and staff at East Maryland Animal Hospital are truly exceptional. I have tried several pet care providers over the past 10 years and never has any one come close to the level of care and customer service we receive at East Maryland. My sweet pit-hound Sunday and I first arrived at EMAH in the panic of a serious health crisis. Her then regular vet's office was unable to diagnose her growing list of symptoms, and we were dismissed with the advice to "probably prepare for the worst". Our visit to East Maryland to seek a second opinion yielded a completely different (and wonderful!) outcome. Her doctor was able to immediately get the diagnostic tests needed to determine a treatment plan, she consulted with several specialists by phone, and even coordinated an appointment for us with another specialty provider that very same day. Flash-forward five years later and my furry bestest girl is still by my side. The exceedingly competent, compassionate care we received at that first visit has remained consistent over the years, and I couldn't more highly recommend a provider to entrust with your furry loved ones.

Dr. Laris did the same thing but not until after he listen to my issues, explained to me the face wash and moisturizers that I should be using... And I can not believe the difference. I was over washing my face and using too many products drying out my skin causing more breakouts. The extra 5 minutes he spent with me going over the basics made a world of difference in my skin.... The staff here is always great as well!! I only get one face, so Thank You Dr. Laris for taking the time to listen!!
GIzHWf1xwRquU43fYR317A	Bars Gay_Bars Nightlife 5_star	I haven't had a night out like this since Living in SF. These ladies had so much vibrance and personality! The show started slightly after 10:30 and I went in on a Friday to celebrate a friends birthday it was worth the wait! Drinks were cheap but the performance was not. The dive bar ambiance gave it a very comfortable feel, don't expect anything fancy except from the ladies. Small parking lot but lots of places to park nearby though! Kudos to the staff! We had a great night :)
C3L0AATBk-L4p1jrYce0Sg	Adult_Entertainment Nightlife 5_star	I haven't been to the Hi-liter in years but have fond memories of this fine establishment. A couple of years ago I was kicked in the head by a dancer who was giving a dance to Mike Tyson... twice! There was no blood so I let it slide... I mean, did I really want to take a chance interrupting Mr. Tyson's good time and risk decapitation? I think not.
Q9rGqkeXJps-Wx8NZFim6Q	Professional_Services Lawyers Estate_Planning_Law 5_star	I highly endorse Samuel Kelsall. He was able to help me and my wife with everything from our will, powers of attorney, and medical directives. Best part, he takes the Metlaw (Hyatt) legal plan so we got very high quality document preparation and filing covered under our legal plan. Consider me a happy customer!!
0b81goCghKzJW9X-NQzPXw	Italian Pizza Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	First time I had pizza here for some reason....and cant they make something that is gross! I have eaten here tons of times and every experience with the food and service is the best ever. I have had the Alfredo the Dark (fettuccine alfredo), the big beef sandwich, the big tuna sandwich, and now chicken wings and pizza. The alfredo is so creamy and flavorful with a bit of spicy to it. I remember not being able to finish the gigantic plate of noodles. The beef sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it but my table was craving to share pizza and wings today so we ordered the pepperoni pizza thin crust and it was truly amazing. The garlic was perfect the crust was and cheese were a great consolidation of flavor. The chicken wings were great also, the sauce was a little thick and had a garlic hint to it as well. Of coarse what would a visit to Oregano's without ordering a macadamia nut pazookie! Man, this place is the best place for the cookie desert with ice cream, the half cooked cookie inside a good 10" pan and about 1/2" thick is so flavorful and good. I almost got sick from eating to much. Also if you have never been to an Oregano's be prepared to wait since they are always busy, the atmosphere is way casual and the decor is so very cool and trendy. I cant think of a better consistent trendy place for great food and great service. It's most definitely as good as it gets!
FdD103B4CtlikIR9zWgHMg	Italian Pizza Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	I have never been disappointed at Oregano's. My friend and I were going there about once a month for a year and a half while we were in school. I had never been here so she introduced me. I have now been there several times and this is my favorite of the locations. The tasters I've tried are the toasted ravioli espaniol, boom dip, guaca tony, and Lawrence's stuffed mushrooms. The ravioli is divine with a nice kick in the cheese and the marinara is my favorite of all of the the marinaras I have tasted. The boom dip is rich and creamy and the chips are actually a thin crust pizza with cheese on top, there are no words to describe how absolutely wonderful it is. The guaca tony has the same thin crust pizza to smear guac on and from what I hear the guac is phenomenal, stupid allergies prohibit me tasting. The stuffed mushrooms are more of a meal than a taster and are a lot meatier than I had imagined but was rich and delicious. If you get tasters just know that they are huge and that if you plan on dessert it is important to have plenty of people to share with unless you plan on not eating lunch/dinner. In regards to the wings my husband has thoroughly enjoyed the wings of fire and says that they are a different kind of hot more black pepper than hot sauce hot. He says that they were surprising but that they were a good change. The salads are like everything else on the menu huge and a little different. The Julius Caesar has a dressing that is Caesar with a little bit of a different kick. I normally ask for extra dressing but there was flavor in every bite. When you add chicken it is finally sliced and you can never get a bite without the chicken, I usually share this with my daughter because it is just to big for one person. My husband has said that the big beefstro and the antipasto thing are both the best salads he has ever had. This is high praise since he tends to not like going out. Every time we have gone out since he compares every salad he comes in contact with the salads from Oregano's and so his taste for other salads has become ruined. My father-in-law says that the southwestern shrimp caesar is better than he ever imagined. The shrimp was so tasty that even I liked it and my daughter started trying to steal salad. We have tried two of the sandwiches sort of on accident. The Italian stuffed and the fresh grilled Italian sausage. My mother-in-law meant to order the fresh grilled Italian sausage but accidentally said the Italian stuffed and when it came out she said it was delicious but that she wanted the sausage and mentioned it to the waitress. The waitress reordered the sausage sandwich and wrapped it up for her to take home and didn't even charge us for it. I think this really says something about the level of customer service that I have seen every time we go. We all tasted both and my mother-in-law who is rarely impressed has suggested this place numerous times based on this, oh and dessert. The pizzas are great. I normally don't like the thin crust but feel that they pack a lot in. I read in a review that the Aunt Margarita had no flavor which I thought was odd. It definitely isn't as greasy as some of the pizzas but it has some darn good flavor. The tomatoes are always done just right to give you that juicy tomato quality. My daughter always gets the pasta with the pesto sauce. She loves the pesto and enjoys the pesto penne bake. I truly love the ziti since it is flavorful and huge enough for three meals. I don't really like their Alfredo the dark but it isn't the worst alfredo that I have had. For dessert I have only ever had their pizza cookie and don't see any reason to change this in the future. I have had pizza cookie at many places but non that are even close to as yummy as the ones her at Oregano's. You will definitely find me at an Oregano's again soon.
sf-GRVhn3vQ5hoH2vwSibA	Italian Pizza Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	AWESOME FOOD!!! I don't know why I've been in AZ 11yrs and this is my 1st visit here. AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME FOOD!!!
kEEbYYBALM5WN2HVYqNDPg	Italian Pizza Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	I am in love with this pizza. I love the crust! I can't eat cheese or meat so I ordered a veggie pizza without the cheese and it was heavenly! I wish there was one closer to where I live.
c2fmiaLFjyL3mMW26FbdSg	Italian Pizza Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	Why five stars? I wouldn't however what strikes me best about this location Is.....Consistency. sure I've been coming here since they opened. This is my first review of them. and I'm happy that not only is the food consistently good on this particular night my server ZAC was very good and went above what I expected. This is the first time in years I've been given a cold side plate for my salad. . he's he was considerate enough to bring a cold side plate... how many times can you count thata server has done that? Zac was cordial considerate and still like a ghost when he had to be..example, My drinks for me and my friends were refilled and I didn't even see him do it.haha nice very nice... Any way the food is good consistently and servers helpful
qM2UtkHbt6pTSLafUD7gzA	Italian Pizza Sandwiches Restaurants 5_star	I love love love their Boom Dip!!! It is to die for!!! Every time I just want one all to myself! They also have Excellent Salads! If you are wondering whether or not to go here.... The answer is yes!!!

wVWZvwCG_0RFkZE-PeW73A	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	This place was outrageously delicious, great service and good atmosphere. It's the kind of place I would want to be a regular at but still have not found in San Francisco. The food and presentation was nothing short of upscale at sweet prices. The waiter was professional, he was at our table when we wanted something and not hanging around when we didn't. It was candle-lit and romantic but had a relaxed atmosphere. In fact, this is my favorite restaurant I have ever been to in my life.
iYBo4lz-dKyMz_Qr2dkAfw	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	OH MY GOD! This place was fantastic, I was visiting a friend of mine in AZ. And this noodle cafe was a breath of fresh air among the fast food joints and the cheesy greasy fattening chain restaurants..... We go in, and the staff was really nice, the service was actually realy good, and the noodles..........omg the Noodles were delicious I had the Yakisoba noodles, and they were fantastic. They had lots of different noodles, so check it out, they were pretty good sounding. It's a nice place to talk with a friend, and they have good food. Check it.
DUZSk3t8Sw913D7dS9bDRg	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	This place depicts fusion at a different level, this cozy place is great tasting and service is great. This is a perfect date place or lunch time place. I really liked the lunch boxes they serve, it included sushi, chicken katsu, bread, rice, and much more...
985fXmRiwtHgz-ufSXUKaQ	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	Cherry Blossom has the best happy hour items! So tasty and fresh!!!! I am in love!
C46mT7Pir5xpQyIAQV2jlg	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	From the second you enter the door, it's pretty obvious that Cherryblossom isn't exactly your usual Japanese restaurant. With the works of Chagall adorning the walls right next to the iconic Japanese beckoning cat statue (aka Maneki Neko), the interior decor definitely alludes to the nature of the food served within its walls. Though firmly rooted in traditional Japanese cuisine, Cherryblossom also has select offerings from across Asia and Europe as well. I wouldn't exactly call it fusion cuisine... more like a meeting of traditions (with some exceptions, of course). As it's name would suggest, Cherryblossom is first and foremost a noodle house. With a wide range of noodles dishes, Cherryblossom definitely does not disappoint in this category. From Japanese noodle soups to stir-fried noodles to Italian pasta, there are more than enough options to suit an array of different palettes. There's even a tofu noodle option for those trying to keep low carb or gluten-free. In addition to the many noodle dishes available, Cherryblossom also serves a wide range of other choices as well. Sushi, rice dishes, salads and assorted tempura are all on the menu to tempt your taste buds. One of my usual go-to favorites is the Vege-Ten noodle soup. Served up in a large bowl, it's a hearty dish featuring either udon (thick wheat) or soba (thin buckwheat) noodles (I'll get either depending on my mood) in a miso soup with an assortment of vegetable tempura placed on top. Although this is usually filling enough for a complete meal unto itself (just because I'm still a big sushi lover even after going vegetarian), I'll also frequently get a vegetable roll (avocado, lettuce, cucumber, carrot, Inari tofu, and kaiware) to accompany my hearty bowl of tastiness... But no matter what you end up ordering, I doubt that you'll be going away unsatisfied. So a small confession... While writing this, I totally got an urge to try one of Cherryblossom's desserts. And since I'm always so full from the meals that I get there, I've never had the opportunity to try one of the pretty desserts inside the glass case. So for just you (and my tummy), I swung out to get a piece of their green tea mousse cake (something that I had been admiring the last couple of times that I had been in)... Although you may think that this cake might be something akin to a typical European chocolate mousse cake, it's most definitely an Asian-style dessert. Light with delicate and subtle flavors, this cake features a thick layer of green tea mousse sandwiched between a thin base of white cake and a layer of red bean paste on top and is served with some fresh berries alongside. Like many Asian desserts, it's not what the typical American palette would consider sweet. It's actually very much like the kinds of cakes that I grew up eating from Chinatown in LA... Maybe not everybody's cup of tea, but I found it pretty good. So long story short... If you find yourself hungry (or even just a little peckish) in the Central Phoenix area, I would highly suggest stopping into Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
liEIvawZHbFkhPYMmeoU0Q	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	Best noodles outside Japan. Very authentic Japanese style restaurant. Try the champon noodles...
HSwHJjG3-zDQ19IiOtTsow	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	Great ramen place!!! I recommend !
hFTuCeY1sX3zPUSy4ZJYmA	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	VERY COOL ITALIAN/JAPANESE FUSION SPOT! I discovered this place because it is one of the few restaurants in the area that serves Ramen. If you're a foody like me, you know what I'm talking about when I say, "Ramen" and not that BS generic top ramen shit... But yes they serve it here! =) The Ramen was pretty good, not as good as Japan or in my hometown Bay Area, CA but it was good! I enjoyed this restaurant because it's probably the only place I've ever been to that specializes in both Japanese and Italian cuisine. THEY HAVE A AWESOME HAPPY HOUR MENU which literally cut the price of some menu items in half! =) MUST TRY AND RECOMMEND!!
oStY9ehHQ-HssS9DQjECEQ	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	5 stars...no 10 stars...f*ck it - I'd give Cherry ALL my stars if I could. I'm moving to SF tomorrow - land of Asian food galore, and where do I go for my last meal out in Phoenix? Yep, Cherry. It's that good. I have a few dear friends to thank for turning me on to this place, and ever since they did I've been having extremely unnatural cravings. Is ramen withdrawal a serious condition? I won't be asking my doctor for fear he says to stop inhaling it. Everything I've tasted at Cherry is divine, but what you come here for is the broth. Broth so delectable you'll want to bathe in it, for real. My recommendations for newcomers: Gyoza Pot Sake Clams Cha-shu TanTan-Men Extra Chili Paste - always Cherry, I will miss you dearly. Luckily I have friends who are sure to send me frequent snapchats of their future noodle feasts. Until we meet again, mmmmmmmmmm.
dosokzLAxt2paEQHQ2EUjw	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 5_star	I've been to cherry blossom before and didn't have a good experience with it. After hearing rave reviews about their ramen, I decided to give it another try. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed their ramen. My husband ordered the spicy Tan-Tan with a side order of sliced pork and I ordered the Cha-shu. I liked them both and would order them again. I really liked the broth and noodles of both bowls. Will be coming back!

fl9oJMyIhpG0ei4VsMK8mw	Thai Restaurants 1_star	The wait was pretty long. But I'm not a very patient person, I'll admit. I went during lunch with my family, so I was able to taste a bit of a few dishes. First of all, their lunch menu is really small. When I sat down and realized that my favorite dishes weren't even on their menu, I was immediately disappointed. I had their papaya salad and honestly, it wasn't that great. It was actually one of the worst ones I've ever had. The flavoring was really off. How do I know? I am Thai and grew up there, so I know what som tum is supposed to taste like. And it really does not taste like that. I had some of their pad thai also and was really really disappointed. I mean, for the prices they charge and for the wait time and horrible service, I was really expecting something really good. The mood was actually really nice. Their decorations and open kitchen were a really nice touch, which is what they're getting the star for. However, it did become very loud very fast when the room filled up. It was difficult to keep a conversation going. For all the hype that people have made about this place, I honestly expected a lot better. But even if I walked in without any expectations, I would have still be disappointed.
tDY14k4Xwc6tKSDLqC6lgg	Food Grocery Shopping Drugstores 1_star	i live 4 blocks away from this "ghetto long line safeway" (as seen on facebook check-in). worst customer "service" ever. usually only has 2 lines open, 3 when people start blocking the entire front of the store. i stopped by tonight to buy a few bottles of my favorite alcoholic beverage, went to the shortest line (the "express" line) and was told by the rent-a-cop that this line was closing and that i had to wait in the other line that was 8 carts deep. i set my basket down, walked out and drove to Fresh & Easy. see ya Ghetto Long Line Safeway.
P6947iFkahRfm4AWBj2ZjA	Food Grocery Shopping Drugstores 1_star	still, the #1 WORST store ever! At this point, I'd pay to have F&E, Fry's, or Food City move into the neighborhood. they wait until the entire front of the store is completely clogged before they even call for another cashier. then, they have to call 3 or 4 times before someone bothers to show up. with chicken heads in Organic chicken, cockroaches in Organic salad, LONG lines, pan handlers & girl scouts in the parking lot, and poor customer service, i'm surprised someone hasn't moved in to the territory. this store is a text book cluster f**k. #worstgrocerystore
mEZq4-zxRBrgIqEUTjgajQ	Fast_Food Mexican Tex-Mex Restaurants 1_star	Why do we stop here and eat? It's cheap, It's fast, the name is familiar? Probably one or all those reasons. But we could be so much kinder to our digestive track if we would just explore out side the box! I once went 15 years without eating at a Taco Bell. Why did I try it again? Must have been an advertisement over powered me. I can be strong again and refuse to eat this crap once again or forever.

Never in my life has this happened to me. And the managers on duty (Anissa or Amy) was completely rude and defensive. Her arguments were invalid and offensive. DO NOT GO HERE!
wCzC-XeRFeor3cPSJ0Egdw	Bars Restaurants American_(Traditional) Sports_Bars Nightlife 1_star	The staff is so rude. Amy and Anissa are the most unprofessional managers I have ever come across. The food is too expensive, the environment is too stuffy and the staff is extremely rude.
QVHL-sWV0ppapnpp5rINhQ	Hotels_&_Travel Taxis Airport_Shuttles Transportation 1_star	First, let me state that I never actually received a ride from this company. I've tried on two separate occasions, but their dispatch team has never allowed me to get that far and has MAJOR customer service issues. The only reason I've ever called this company is because their phone number is so easy to remember. On my most recent call to the company (which just happened to be last night), I had to call from a pay phone because my cell phone battery died. Someone answered about 6 rings later and mumbled "hello," no mention of the company or even the employee's name. I asked for a ride home from the Phoenix Public Library over on Central and McDowell, and the dispatcher asked for the address. I told him I don't know the address and he told me to "ask someone for it." I explained that I can't just walk around asking for the address because I'm on a payphone and there is no one within 30 feet of me. So he responded, "Oh, well, I need an address to get a cab to you." I ended up looking through a stack of torn up phone books searching for the address while he held a conversation with one of his co-workers. None of them listed the library address and the dispatcher hung up on me after a minute. I called another cab company immediately afterwards and had absolutely no problem with them. The dispatcher didn't ask for the library's address (in fact, she stated it just after I told her where I was) and didn't hold a conversation with co-workers about weekend exploits. Never calling Yellow Cab again.
CeRj_Xc06e2yw98LeIJgaw	Hotels_&_Travel Event_Planning_&_Services Hotels 1_star	I stayed at this hotel for a conference and it was terrible! I understand it is an old building but old buildings don't have to be dirty and falling apart. Poor, poor, poor, terrible value for what you pay (on this occasion a "special" conference rate of $199). Tiles in the bathroom were chipped, dirty, and in need of repair, the "art" on the wall was falling apart inside the frame, the pillows smelled like they were washed in beer, furniture and doors had chipped paint, you can hear your neighbors coughing and taking showers, your skin is scalded in the shower whenever someone flushes the toilet in your wing of the hotel, and there is a story and picture of a rape and murder line up next to the elevator. If that run-on sentence doesn't detract you then look at the rest of the reviews on here-- more than half of them seem like fake 4* ratings and the rest tell the true story and echo my complaints.
6FzLwomewolXhofqsuFGwQ	Breakfast_&_Brunch Restaurants 1_star	I have been going to this IHOP every month for 4 years. Our group is anywhere from 8 to 25. There are only two places in the restaurant that accommodate groups and for the most part, we have been seated relatively quickly. Over the past year, service has gone down hill. It started taking forever to get our order taken, get our drinks, or get our food. We are a very forgiving bunch and know it's not easy to serve a large group but as service started really sliding, our last trip ended the relationship. We had about 20 people and knew we would have to wait a bit, but after 30 minutes, we inquired how long and it was like "your waiting for a table?"the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups. How can you not remember a group when they take up the whole lobby? We called a near by breakfast place and they were thrilled to have our party, which grew smaller since some left at that point. We found a new home and they will get 5 stars on my review.

I specialize in copy right and entertainment law in Los Angeles, and found this to be stunningly petty. You can decide if that's an environment you'd like to go to for your entertainment.
B613lHQDA6sQE-LYoj7hrQ	Asian_Fusion Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I haven't yelped in about 2 months, and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me. Well, this place was that bad. First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice. No beers on tap though; and seriously, what's with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm? Come on guys, way too early for that. It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, that's right, no menus yet, good job. O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles. Seriously?! Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in. Yuck. And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice. I'm sorry, isn't it supposed to be the other way around? My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless). So yeah, I don't recommend this place. Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food.
j2PJ63Q83qf75PNIUZHg0A	Mexican Restaurants 1_star	I was so proud of myself for finally getting around to cashing in the $5 coupon I received for running the 10K Turkey Trot last Thanksgiving, which Mi Amigo's sponsors, and I gotta tell ya, I really, really wish I hadn't. Bad food, worse service. The waitress was hot, though. Rude, but hot. I ordered the Shrimp & Scallop Enchiladas, which basically consisted of a couple stale tortillas covered with runny cheese, topped off with half a dozen miniature shrimps and scallops. Oh, and a small pile of cold beans and white (white, really?) rice. My date actually grimaced when they brought out the food - grimaced! - and said, "You're not really going to eat that, are you?" We were in a drinking mood and surely would have spent good money doing it, but after she brought the food, we never saw the hot waitress again - Ever! - and I actually had to get up and ask another, much less attractive waitress for the bill. Here's the best part - they took my $5 coupon but didn't apply it to the bill. A-holes.
1dBtLIIrQfIc8dTGRJ6lAg	Bars American_(Traditional) Sports_Bars Nightlife Chicken_Wings Restaurants 1_star	Me and some friends wanted to get some lunch and decided to head over at this location. This was my first time there. We walked in and nobody greeted us at the entrance and we decided to walk over to one of the open tables. We sat down and waited for about 20 minutes for a server to come by and finally stopped one of the servers. I noticed that there were one bartender and two servers. The server told us that someone will be with us shortly. We were ok with that but it was not busy at all. then after another 15 minutes or so, I decided to walk up to the bartender and asked if we can get some service and at least get us some drinks. Finally, one of the two servers stopped at our table and took our drink and food orders. After she took our orders, we had waited close to 20 minutes and we didn't even get our drinks yet. We were there for almost an hour to get lunch and didn't even get our drinks. I got up and told the bartender that the service is bad and that we are leaving. We got up and walked away. I left this location with a bad experience and hungry.
IajFEcKFwvfCr3ZIKmojhg	Restaurants Italian 1_star	I think Calamari F. pretty much summed it up. OSF serves absolutely inedible "Italian" food that is far worse than the usual Americanized Italian fare you get at chain Italian restaurants like Olive Garden. I would have rather had seafood alfredo from Red Lobster. The prices were also very high. The only good thing about our experience was the "free" spumoni ice cream that comes with every entree purchase. Avoid at all costs.
w8E7EXtjpDmEN10naSxS_g	Restaurants Italian 1_star	I was suprisingly displeased this time around. It was my 2nd time there and it wasn't anything like I remembered. The salad was DRENCHED in dressing (which I hate) so if you don't like that, get your dressing on the side. All I ordered was the soup and salad lunch special. They brought me my first salad which consisted of, literally, maybe 11 pieces of iceberg lettuce, 3 slivers of carrots, 4 slivers of cabbage, and about 8oz of dressing!! absolutely disappointing. I ordered my second salad with the dressing on the side and, of course, they brought me a REAL-SIZE salad the 2nd time. They should have done that the first time. The service was slow as hell and they brought us 2 loaves of bread (bc we had a party of 7) with only 1 knife. It was retarded all around. Just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals. It was lunch hour, I'll give them that....but they weren't even busy!!! Never going there again :(
54C2D8hBRxHhfDzttlFxrQ	American_(Traditional) Restaurants 1_star	i recently moved into cityscape, a high rise apt. bldg. just a block or two away from this establishment and i've started trying out the local eateries as i don't like to cook much. i ordered a tavern burger and cottage cheese. when asked how i wanted the burger i said well done, meaning no pink, but specifically stated i didn't want the burger to be burned and/or dry. the bartender assured me that would not happen. well, guess what? the burger was way overdone and left a bad aftertaste that lingered for quite a while. i should have requested the burger be tossed and another mad however i just wasn't in the mood for a hassle. plus the bartender never did ask how my food was. it's a shame as i left very unsatisfied and with a burnt taste in my mouth, unlikely to every return or to recommend this place to others. i'm sure it was not intentional but the result was still the same.

The hours on the door indicated they were open until 5:30 and I arrived right at 5pm. The branch was empty with the exception of a few employees. I was greeted by one of the tellers. I explained my desire to apply for a loan and was directed to a young man named Anthony. Anthony could barely muster a friendly attitude. He was visibly annoyed to have to deal with me so close to branch closing hours. Immediately realizing his frustration I apologized for coming in so late and explained that I (like most people) have to work until at least 5pm but was able to get away a few minutes early to take care of some business. One benefit to his eagerness to be done with me is that he flew through the process. I was literally done by 5:18. At which point his attitude improved significantly. The very next day I received a follow-up call from the Sunwest Federal Credit Union loan team. They needed some additional information which I was happy to provide. I'm not sure what it is about the folks at this Credit Union but again I got a huge amount of attitude. It was clear she felt bothered to have to deal with me. Ultimately I decided to take my business elsewhere. There are just too many other banks and credit unions that would appreciate my time and business. I'd recommend that you make a similar decision if good friendly customer service is important to you and your preferred banking experience.

I walked away, as I was at the convention center, willing to spend a few shekles... and left annoyed at the state this center is in.
FNh_yCvBatq-iPqsqZIPpw	Delis Fast_Food Sandwiches Restaurants 1_star	I will never go in this restaurant again. I have been there several times, with each visit the manager being more rude and insulting than the last time. My friends could not believe the things I told them he said to me during my last (definitely last) visit. You can get better New York food elsewhere without the New York attitude. Complaints to the headquarters go unanswered. So I assume Schlotzsky's does not care about customers.
Ig2vku_qcecDMpZfEE7yig	Barbeque Restaurants 1_star	OMG what happened to this place? We hadn't been here in awhile, but the brisket was overcooked and soupy. The links had no taste except were very spicy. If the brisket at Dallas and Austin airports rate an 8, then this is a definite one or two. They say your first instincts are best; we first went into the Philly sub place next door that had Coke products and walked out. Instead we had overcooked, tasteless brisket and RC soda and spent $30 for two. I was even going save some for the dogs, but I wouldnt have enough padding for the explosion that would cause. Thank God I have a good cigar to get the taste out!!!
fJUqM9CNCm9LoT8_amouuA	Barbeque Restaurants 1_star	I've been to this location more times than I could ever count. It has always been my "go to"! But $10 for a combo meal?! HOOOLY MOLY prices have gone up and absolutely nothing has changed!!! I truly cant believe how bad this place has become over the years. The young cashier girl was so rude. She was almost annoyed that we were coming in- to spend $24 on lunch! The peach cobbler was TERRIBLE. I had to scrap the bottom of the crock pot thing to get some extra BBQ sauce... I'm SO disappointed. Every time I go in it just gets worse and worse. There are so many other wonderful places to eat in downtown Phoenix. Honey Bears, you're just making it easier and easier to get else where.
V_JlrVzj8Qjvmw6Qw1P0Ag	American_(Traditional) Restaurants 1_star	I am from out of town and have never been to a restaurant at a ball game, so I was excited to go to Front Row to watch the DBacks game. The website gave very conflicting messages about when you could purchase the seats in Front Row for the game, so I gave the restaurant a call over a week in advance. They said I could only purchase tables the day of. I called the night before the game, hoping that maybe they would make an exception because I really wanted these tickets. I then found out that the tickets have been available all season! I asked to speak to the manager, who was the rudest human being I have ever spoke to in my life! After about an hour on the phone with him, tears, and being called a liar, I decided to hang up and just call customer service. I understand that the table I wanted had already been reserved, I just wanted the manager (Lyle) to try to help fix the issue. He said there was nothing he could do, and that "EVERYONE knows you can buy the tickets all year round"... what a piece of crock. I cannot believe I was talked to in the way that he spoke to me, and I am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him. I just read some previous reviews about him on this site, and it's so funny that everyone agrees with me. If you don't have any issue when you go there, then you'll be fine. But if you have even the slightest complaint that has to go through Lyle.... don't expect to leave happy.
x5PF3iyPzeeJTyhSyPDy-g	Hotels_&_Travel Event_Planning_&_Services Hotels 1_star	I chose this motel because it is 3 blocks from downtown. I wanted to be able to walk back and fourth for a couple days. Upon check in I was greeted with zero smiles, and made to feel more like he was doing me a huge favor. The older gentlemen with white hair was very very clear that this was not a "party" motel. And that we will get removed immediately if there was even 1 complaint? I found this interesting since I am a mellow 45 year old who does not appear to be a partier in the least bit. He then went over the no smoking policy and that we'd be charged $150.00 cleaning deposit if we smoked. Even though the office smelled of cigarette smoke. LoL.... And nobody in my family smokes. I simply smiled and looked at my wife and said, "Well, looks like we came to the right place honey"' I was utterly disgusted at the layer of filth on the outside of the building. I wiped my finger on the outside windowsill and it turned black. Old gum, some kind of splash stains, trash, all in view on the way to the room. Every outside plastic trash can within view was barely holding together like they had been run over and stood back up. They are cracked to death and appear to be very old as they are faded? One of our rooms (we have older kids with us) reeked of cigarette smoke as we entered. I immediately opened the door and cranked the fan to try and air it out. I noticed the batteries were missing in the smoke alarm. I went to the office to report this and was met with apathy from now a female attendant. She told me she could swap out a room and would call me in 20 minutes. I told her that I did not want to get charged with a smoking violation. We went back and hung out in our other room. DISGUSTING. The corners of the rooms floors are filled with lint, dust, and food particles where it looks to never to have been vacuumed. Stains on the carpet and chair seating area. There were small chunks of seat cushion under the chair in the corner as if had not been moved or cleaned under in a long time. When I looked behind the tv cabinet in search for an outlet I saw a former tenants Old Spice deodorant covered in dust along with numerous crumpled kleenex? Seriously? After walking around the room in my socks for about 30 minutes they were black on the bottom. Gross. I can only guess that the cleaning crew blows through each room doing the least amount of work they can. We found evidence that one of our beds sheets had not been changed. After an hour I had never received a phone call that was promised. I went back to the front office for some coffee. The same lady was there and I told her to forget changing our room. And that it had aired out pretty good. I actually just gave up and decided to just try and help my family enjoy our few days here. After dealing with the manager who was very clear that we were here for them, and the condition of the room, I knew trying to get them to see reality would be more frustrating that just letting it go. So I did. I figured I'd inform possible customers of what they might be getting into. And I honestly hope Super 8 contacts the management here and tries to fix these easily remedied issues. Later that night after two of my kids showered. their tub (in room 108, the stinking smoke room that still stunk) did not drain. I walked back to the front office and met the lady again. She told me that they only had 1 plunger and that they had given it to another room and that they were asleep already. I now asked for a new room. She told me she would see what she could do and that she would let me know and call me back at my room. I never heard back from them the entire stay. Not to see if we were ok? Not to offer to replace the missing batteries (code violation)? The next morning we tried to enjoy the free breakfast. Ok at least they are trying I guess. But when the OJ ran out the white haired guy fixed it but did not say a word to us as we said thank you. He really makes it clear that he just does not enjoy people. We will never stay her again. And I feel like we should get a partial refund. I understand things happen. But this place is a joke. I would be embarrassed to work here. And I refuse to believe management doesn't know what is going on. Just hard to believe people can just not care. UPDATED JANUARY 26TH. After returning home 3 outta4 of my kids developed little red bites along the backs of their necks, on their sides and on our 2 yr old under his diaper on his belly. We determined that they were in fact bed bug bites. Fortunitely they did not make it back to our house. They did end up going away and have not returned since.
wcxLstaLZi4djsZXFT7ENw	Grocery Mexican Food Ethnic_Food Specialty_Food Restaurants 1_star	I have eaten here many times and have not been impressed with the taste of the food or the prices compared to other places. Today we went for lunch. My veggie burrito was almost $6 and not very appetizing. A co-worker was very disappointed also. She ordered a side salad for $3.99 and what she got was a side of shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, cilantro/onion (which we would have told them to leave off had we known they were going to put it on a salad), cheese, tortilla chips and a packet of ranch. It seemed like a bunch of toppings thrown together with chips and ranch dressing. I would recommend Ranch Market (16th St./Roosevelt), Ritos (14th St/Roosevelt) or Los Charros (10th St/VanBuren) instead.
BifhZDNfMU14F_bJdB1jhA	Local_Services Community_Service/Non-Profit 1_star	This review is solely about volunteering here. They do not return phone calls or emails. They treat people that want to volunteer their time horribly! On facebook former volunteers/vanguards are always complaining. Sojourner Center should start treating better those willing to work for free! This is a disgrace. The horror stories that i heard and my personal experience of not even treated as a person that should have emails returned is just unbelievable. Want to volunteer? Look elsewhere.

Undercoooked hamburger meat, and the server's fingers in my food dirty. Flies on the lip of the water pitcher dirty. Somehow these guys think that if you wear gloves you are spared from all contamination. As if scratching your ass with your gloves on will keep the ass germs from getting in your food. I've been there before, and have tried to look past all these things, when eating such delicious food, but really, it's not worth it anymore.

zNx5l_z6H-ggZtEtQSR0sA	Latin_American Salvadoran Restaurants 1_star	I was so excited to try the pupusas after reading the reviews, but all the hype didn't reflect my experience.....located in a bright blue building, it was very unassuming....we entered through the back into a dimly lit, but very clean dining area. The menu sounded good and had photos of everything to make it easy to choose. my daughter and We ordered the Plato Tipico to get an idea of what they had to offer. The tamale smelled and tasted of funky fish (I think it was actually pork and potato) with under cooked masa, there were beef empanadas, deep fried hard things that I think were potato and the bean and cheese pupusas...everything tasted of the oil it was cooked in and was very bland. The cabbage slaw accompaniment was of no help in adding flavor. I also had the horchata which was very good. We tried ordering a dessert, however after taking our order, the server came back several minutes later to tell us they were out so we ordered something else only to be told later they were out of that too. Finally we ordered the pork, bean and cheese pupusas to give one more try...it was very cheesey but bland with an odd meat taste. Overall a very disappointing experience.
jNyGqcGKVDsNw34u-5zBGg	Food Burgers Ice_Cream_&_Frozen_Yogurt Sandwiches Restaurants 1_star	The only reason I would give this place a 1 star rating is due to their amazing soda and float selection. The food was absolutely disgusting. I never complain about food and I've definitely never sent food back, until tonight. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and was shocked to see that fries aren't even offered as a side. I took one bite of the burger and found bone fragments in the frozen beef. My sister also sent back her bean/veggie burger. It looked equally disgusting. It will take a lot of convincing to get me to go back.

0tEsrtZdJnJbQwc3L2uoNQ	Home_Services Real_Estate Apartments 1_star	I would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone. Several negatives affect this review: 1. My car was broken into! This is a "gated" community where the gate doesn't work half of the time! 2. The apartment staff don't seem to care about their renters. Maintenance is a second thought, with little to no urgency. When asking about a piece of mail that was delivered to the office, they seemed to have no idea where it could have gone and keep no log of incoming or outgoing mail. On top of that, they didn't care enough to find the mail! 3. Grounds are kept at a minimum. Dog bags are refilled occasionally, bushes are cut haphazardly. Overall, just unkempt. I'd say stay away from this place!!

SNR5SSxQkNz0xWggDfT1pg	Home_Services Real_Estate Apartments 1_star	Killing 15 roaches a day, trash piling on the ground all around the garbage bins because they are too full at least once a week, never ever having hot water (maybe once or twice a month for a very short amount of time) and heating and cooling not working even after being repaired. These are just some of the things that you will have to look forward to if you live here. Sure the rent is cheap and it seems quiet but try leaving for work at 4 or 5 in the morning, you'll find black guys digging through the trash cans. Good morning, is that the overwhelming smell of dog piss I'm smelling? Why yes it is. Animal piss puddles all over the sidewalks and good crap that the residents have yet to pick up. Sure you are paying for a parking space in your monthly rent but you'll have your spot taken or blocked 1-2 times a week every single week that you live there. If these things are things that you can look past for the price of rent try wrapping your head around suctioning 3 baby roaches from your sons nose because he can't breathe. This is a second floor apartment mind you, imagine the bottoms are much worse.
WbqE1sPUxUJNjSV8wgJKHQ	Mexican Restaurants 1_star	I have put off writing this review for so long because the memories of my experience there are so ugly that I needed weeks to recover. It was my Aunt's birthday and she _loves_ Macayo's. I went along begrudgingly and the results were terrifying. As a Phoenix native, I've known Macayo's on Central for decades. Its unique facade emulates the style of some grand Guatemalan Mayan temple, but... no, not really. And what is it that you want when you see pictures of Machu Picchu or of Tikal? You want to climb the steps, to _go in_. In the case of Macayo's, you must resist this urge with all your might. The main entrance is from the back and is true to form in the Egyptian style. A post and lintel rectangular opening leads to a long narrow hallway slightly sloped which opens to an antechamber branching off to the splendorous caverns within. Um. Except this article is about _food_, not a history of architecture lecture! Bleh. As is my custom I order a cheese crisp straight off; I'm allergic to corn so the endless bowls of hardened, impervious-to-rot corn chips (see pic) just repel me. After the pushy (more on that later) waitress scurries off I notice my fork (see the picture) and realize that with the caked-on food, this place might be cutting corners on lots of stuff, namely that the tortillas might be so cheap that they are the type to be sprinkled with corn starch to keep them from sticking to each other. The waitress returns and I ask her to please check the ingredient list for the tortillas for corn starch. A few minutes later she returns with the label torn from the tortilla bag and says that without her glasses she cannot read the list. I'm not joking when I say that the list goes on as long as this paragraph. Chemical after chemical, non-food food after non-food food. And then there right in the middle is corn starch, corn meal, corn flour and corn syrup. In FLOUR tortillas! I immediately canceled my order for the cheese crisp and resolved not to place a single bite of anything into my mouth. "Was the water bad too?" I wondered. I'm not sure where it started, but Tex-Mex goers have come to expect the attentive busboys to continually flit about filling and refilling bowls of corn chips and salsa. Macayo's sets the standard. It seemed the bowls dropped every few seconds as my family devoured them while waiting for the birthday girl to show. The salsa was gloopy (again with the pic) and might have had something added to the mix after it was poured from a gigantic vat, but I doubt it. My sensible companion said it didn't taste fresh at all. The birthday girl was almost 45 minutes late. After 40 minutes we discussed among us just ordering anyway. We decided to order, except that our decision quickly became an argument with the waitress who insisted that we wait for her. Um, whoa! Is this really happening to me? I must be in some kind of Mayan burial temple, I'm dead, and my servants and family were buried with me along with food and I'm going to be here for the next thousand years until someone decrypts the secret book and inserts the starfish-shaped key into the stony entrance to free my evil spirit back on the world. AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Yes, I loved the Mummy movies. But back to our pushy waitress. After the family tried over and over, unsuccessfully, to cajole me into ordering something, anything, we waited for the results. You'll have to see the pictures. You know you're in a nightmare of menu hell when an item's description has to change languages from English in order to accurately describe its content. The average speaker uses something like 20,000 words regularly and you can't even find a few to accurately or even poetically describe this item? The steak was described with being covered in a spinach queso sauce (see pic). Those two words had to have been taken straight off the labels of the two cans that were dumped into a warming pot to create this sauce. Think nacho cheesy, oil and corn starch and that lovely orangey-yellow coloring. Disgusting. My brother ordered a taco plate (see pic) and made the mistake of trying to bite into the taco shell with his teeth. This item should have come with a disclaimer and a hammer. Envision eating crab but with the shell still on it. He gave up quickly and dug out the innards with his fork, snail style. Macayo's should stick to their success like some cornstarch-less badly made stack of tortillas, namely large-scale manufactured canned foods sold to those who still think Phoenix is a town of rolling tumbleweeds and cowboys. Let them fantasize about questing to Phoenix and entering the secret Mayan temple to discover the secrets within. They can release my tormented soul from the hell that is Macayo's.
CGqmK_MRhXUNfO9N2jXznA	Italian Pizza Sandwiches Restaurants 1_star	My name is Matthew and i Ordered 2 cheese pizzas w/extra sauce. Was excited I received an email couponcoupon for a $10 pizza. Went to pick it up on way from work...and after I had a discussion with some of the employees about the coupon and number of pizzas I was allowed by the manager James to have it honored. The staff before him said I could only have one pizza. So James settles it which was cool of him. Then I get home find out I have 2 pizzas w/o pizza sauce and only cheese. So I guess the lady that took down my order over the phone was confused. Why would anyone want only xtra cheese and no pizza sauce?So I call James back to let him know what happen and he agreed to credit my ATM card. So least to say dinner was ruined for my kids/family. Now we are off to my son's baseball game starving. I now will wait patiently for my refund to post on my bank account. Oh what fun!

14_ZI9jZVMJYYORdqjVP2A	Pubs Bars Nightlife British Restaurants 1_star	From the other descriptions I am reading, I believe our party had the same blond bartender. Granted she didn't curse out anyone in our party, but it wasn't a very pleasant experience. It's like she can't be bothered and perform her job in pleasant manner. Why employ anyone like that? Last time I checked, restaurants were in the SERVICE industry, so provide better service or customers won't come back.

ifpwckxu8R5Qz5Yjp8jrcA	 1_star	I purchased a 18 X 36 print recently that I planned on framing. I stopped in Aaron Brothers even though I was planning on going to Michael's. The lady there was very friendly and knowledgeable. She helped to choose a mat and frame. After everything was decided, she ran it through the computer and said the job would cost $675.00. I thought I must have heard wrong. She said it was correct and that it would normally be $975 but she was applying a 30% discount. I asked if we could look at an off the shelf frame. We picked one. The price of the frame was $32.50 and with a mat and labor it came to $185. Still more than I expected, but I decided to do it. She informed me that it could be ready July 30th, exactly one month. I laughed as I was leaving the store. How the hell do they stay in business? I did notice that there were two employees present and one customer, me. No surprises there.
RYLCHDohspOVBF7VaHP_qA	Vegetarian Buffets Salad Restaurants 1_star	Oh shit! Literally. I was at this location on Sunday night (2/25/07) and it was horrible. The first thing we noticed was that there weren't any dishes. It was like nothing new was being washed and brought out for customers to use. Then the place started to smell bad... and then we noticed the waste water bubbling up from the floor drains behind the salad bar. It was like something out of a horror movie. We left in a hurry... a drainage grate in the parking lot was flowing with more raw sewage. It was amazingly gross. Any good experiences I've ever had in this place are moot... I'm never going back to this location again.
aRR6NwDDzNxN6A1ZLafO3Q	Flowers_&_Gifts Shopping Florists 1_star	I unfortunately had the same experience as the other reviewer, I bought flowers for my wife and they died within a day or two. Scary how similar my experience with the staff was. They were rather rude regarding their poor flower selection and life of their flowers. I definitely will not do business with them again. Thomas H and Aurora E posted on the same day right after the "owners" response using very similar language and typing skills; i.e. using caps for a number of words and the poor grammar is the same. That is a little suspect but I know it happens on yelp. It's rather sad this company has to stoop to such low levels. You would think they would just apologize and want to offer good customer service instead of quoting policy over and over. In the "owners" 357 word response, not a single "sorry" or "we will do better" or "we will make it right" comment. Nothing but a long winded explanation about what their policy is and why they are like Macy's (ironic that Macy's actually has amazing customer service and would probably be upset knowing this flower shop is comparing their lack of customer service to Macy's). I think that is very telling about the owner's and staff at this shop. I love supporting local business, but not ones that act like you should be thankful for doing business with them, it should be the other way around.
peuU4NsOn_saBBRh-HvJqw	Bars Gay_Bars Nightlife 1_star	Went here yesterday to see the drag show with my friend (and fellow transperson) Fenyx. Cruisin had everything I would ever want out of a bar; seedy atmosphere, cheap drinks, a stage, friendly bartenders, and trannies, crossdressers, and drag queens as far as the eye could see. For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's. But alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time. While waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side. So he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him. "Awwww, man, now you've locked us out," we say, playfully. The DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with "Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out" before walking off with his cigarette. "What the hell just happened?" I ask. "He thinks we're a straight couple." I laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused. I tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. I knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts. I'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess. Oh well. Torrid and Guitar Center seem to do just fine without my business. I'm sure Cruisin 7th will do just fine.
Onc5hrKRjXI28ioUULKiRQ	Local_Services Dry_Cleaning_&_Laundry 1_star	Went to wear the Free People gauze tiered top I had paid to have CLEANED, and there are STILL spots on the garment. I had spilled a couple of drops of strawberry milkshake on the bodice and it evidently dripped to the lower tier, unbeknownst to me when I brought in the top to be CLEANED at Fashion Cleaners. The spot I did point out on the bodice is gone, but Fashion Cleaners did not look for other spots, and three remain. So I spent about $7.00 for a half-baked job. Filed complaint with the Better Business Bureau and guess what? They have ignored it. The following transpired on 11/9/13, AFTER the BBB closed the complaint because the owner(s) had not responded: Rec'd response re complaint and DANA still doesn't get it. No remorse, no apology, no acceptance/admission of mistakes. A grudging refund with a nasty reply. Can you say "pass the buck and blame everything on a customer"? Fashion Cleaners CAN and DOES! I sent these people about a dozen pictures of what I was talking about...feel,sorry for the co-owner, who doesn't seem half-bad, but when a person such as his partner presents the way she did with me, I just cannot, in good conscience, revise my rating.

G1LX_ZjE-xemh9sG9r_s4A	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 1_star	This was one of the few times Yelp has led us wrong. Came here because it was close by & had 4 stars. I will say the service was perfectly fine. Our server was very friendly & even though it was busy, we were greeted at the door & sat quickly. Unfortunately, it was downhill from the point we got our food. We ordered an assortment of rolls & a dish of pad Thai. The sushi choices almost all include cream cheese &/or tempura, which made it difficult to choose a variety without everything tasting similar. The sushi all tasted fishy. I don't think it was unfresh, but it certainly didn't taste fresh either. It was somewhere in between the two...if that is possible. The presentation wasn't bad either, but the overall experience was tainted by the poor tasting sushi.
OUBd3VDQZ78Z-83t584Knw	Asian_Fusion Italian Japanese Restaurants 1_star	I'm giving one star and that's being generous considering the horrible service my coworkers and I just experienced, it was appalling! I have never dealt with such a rude person while trying to get simple take out! From the phone call placing our order to walking out, food in hand, every moment we felt like we were not welcome. I understand gathering four separate orders can be a pain but you're a restaurant, I can't imagine we were the first group with this request! I'm not saying I will never eat here again because that is not the case but I can say I will never get take out for more then one person from here, what a mess!! VERY disappointed!
7dcYIblnnOMKjQ9a3Tot9g	Shopping Photography_Stores_&_Services 1_star	I called this store to inquire if they had a Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM in stock. They said they had a few. I asked if they could get anywhere close the amazon's price. He asked how much they were selling it for, and i replied $339. He then started yelling at me that they are losing $40 on the lens, and good luck. He was rude started bitching to me. I asked could you do any better, and he basically said good luck and hung up the phone. Get with the program. The price of the lens is $399 retail. Don't tell me you only make $20 on a lens sale. I want to support local businesses, but I'm not going to drive 20 minutes to over pay for something I can have overnighted to me for $60 cheaper. What is really ridiculous about the whole thing is I also ordered a $1100 L glass lens from amazon as well, which I paid full retail for. They could have had both orders, if he didn't treat me like sh*t. If you want to survive as a local business, you need to be nice to your customers. If you don't want to price match then be nice about it. Don't try to bully someone into buying something. If you know a customer is just going to order it, I think you would be better off selling it and only making $20, then losing that business and any future business from the customer. I have personally spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on photography equipment, always the highest end lenses, and camera bodies. In fact I bought my last camera body at their store, but I will never make that mistake again. You lost my business for good, and I am sure I will not be the last one.
qN3NXsGrGdWGjr4uvWb0tw	Mexican Restaurants 1_star	Terrible. For a city so lavishly seasoned with some of the best Mexican food on the planet, this place coulnt have been worse if it tried. Outdated, dingy, dining space and help. I love me a good hole in the wall, but Jordan's can't even hit that mark. Avoid it!!!
40ffmfmtQrUqBOahUABrRg	Women's_Clothing Used,_Vintage_&_Consignment Fashion Shopping Men's_Clothing 1_star	I'm writing this review purely as a seller. So I am a total shopaholic! I guess that's what happens when you work in the industry. Anyways, I cleaned out my closet and came here and they literally took 1 pair of jeans out of maybe 40-50 items. I mostly brought in some old work clothes from Banana Republic and just some odds and ends that no longer fit. This place is solely for indy/punky/trendy, which they do make quite clear so they are what they say they are which is good. Makes me kind of wonder how many people buy and sell back the same items though...
U_ULgvCws_gM79_YTBAAZw	Sandwiches Pizza Chicken_Wings Restaurants 1_star	I like Dominos when I need cheap, delivery pizza for the kids after a long day and no one wants to cook or go pick up better pizza. I was quoted 35 minutes for a delivery time on 2 separated occasions now and it actually took 70 minutes. All i got from the store manager was this, verbatim "Oh ya we got slammed and the pizza tracker doesn't really work. I don't know why they even have that." What a bunch of inconsiderate assholes. I will be getting my money back or calling my credit card company and declining the charges.
na3M7mM3J4b3tCb29a9iUg	American_(Traditional) Chinese Restaurants 1_star	"If I could rate this place 0 stars I would" I have been to the Long Wongs in Tempe, so my boyfriend and I thought of stopping by here, we wanted to watch the championship game and we needed a place quick. We go in wanting some drinks, well the bar was closed...fine, we went and sat at a table a couple feet from a tv, perfect! We asked what draft beers they had and she said they had Bud Light, Coors Light, and Budweiser, so my boyfriend ordered a coors and i got vodka cranberry, she brought over a bottle of coors light and I walked over to the bar and looked at their tap handles and they also had Shocktop and Sierra Nevada on tap as well. Servers clearly do not know what they even have here. After waiting for about 30 minutes for our appetizer, we finally got it and then 10 minutes later we got our two burgers. We had no napkins and when we were looking for our server who seemed to be non-existent all night we saw her talking with the manager behind a wall, after staring at them for a few minutes he finally noticed and sent her to come check on us for the first time the whole meal. Over all just awful service, our server did not know about food or drinks and on top of it could barely communicate with us. We were there to watch a game along with two other tables of five guys each who were clearly watching the championship and cheering loudly. After about 15 minutes while trying to figure out why I could barely hear the game I realized they had TV on a news channel right behind the counter, and the server & manager were also playing music from a jukebox on the other side of the restaurant in the "closed" bar so loudly I couldn't make out any distinct audio and once we asked why there was music playing she replied "oh we're listening to music." My boyfriend and I both have been working in the industry for years and we are completely understandable of a busy restaurant and things taking a few minutes. There were TWO other tables in there and our server was seen 2 times, our food took forever, and the burgers were not worth it at all. We finally got the check and payed and left, we wrote a small note about how the service was awful (we wanted to talk to the manager but he was too busy trying to get it in clearly) and this is where it gets so much better. We left and saw him walk outside, but we were already on the main street so we called and told him about the situation, he asked us "Yes, was there a problem?" We told him about everything, the service, her not being knowledgable of any of her surroundings or her menu, and he replied "oh...okay" This place is a disaster, they clearly need to make some decisions to get this place turned around or need a complete new management staff, they lost potential regulars and I will tell every single person I can how awful of an experience I had. DO NOT GO HERE!!!
wSlLyptK531AUw6Hm5WxeA	Arts_&_Crafts Shopping Knitting_Supplies Hobby_Shops 1_star	I don't know what I am doing writing a review for this store that no one (at least no one with any ability to change anything there) will ever read. Nevertheless, I came, I saw, I left empty handed as nothing (in truth, not one little thing) in my entire basket rang up as it was marked on the shelf. I don't know if it is incompetence, stupidity, or a laudable "I don't give a flying f" attitude that makes this the worst Michaels in the area, but I am not sure I have the time to devote to studying the subject matter. I think my favorite part of today's experience was when the third item rang up wrong and I told the cashier, she said "oh" and looked blindly like a deer in headlights. No "I'll check on that for you," no "do you still want it," just a blank stare. Sadly, I'll be back next week because this is the closest one when I am out and about. But seriously, as soon as I find an acceptable online substitute, I am outta here.
-2l-Gcro_paZuc5PV_Rg8A	Bars Dive_Bars Burgers Nightlife Chicken_Wings Restaurants 1_star	As a loyal (former) patron of Harvey's Wineburger for over 40 years, I can now announce that the change of ownership in the past year or so has murdered the magnet that kept customers coming back - their hamburgers. A good friend was in Harvey's in the past month, and ask me to go there with him today. He said on his previous visit, he got a lousy hamburger and suspected something had changed. His assessment was quite accurate. The first thing you notice when the burger is delivered is that the bun has shrunk and that the burger patty has become perfectly round, as compared to its 'jagged' predecessor, and flattened - maybe pre-formed and frozen? The first bite discloses the sad news: the meat is tasteless, rubbery, and absolutely nothing like the burger that has kept the joint in business 40-plus years. Astonishingly, you can no longer taste any hint of wine in the burger. My guess is that the rubbery consistency of the meat (they OBVIOUSLY have changed their supplier and/or grade) rejects the wine poured on it like water on Bullfrog sunscreen. We had heard about the ownership change several months ago with someone commenting that "oriental owners" had taken over. The smaller microwaved-tasting bun and the Birkenstock meat are clear signs the new ownership has resorted to use of cheap ingredients - specifically the meat - the landmark's staple - to squeeze more profits while raising prices that are unrecognizable to Harvey's regulars. It's quite sad. This was one of my favorite places in Phoenix - a wineburger and a game of pool - never crowded - that old dive charm...and hands down in the top 5 best burgers in town. Apparently the new owner(s) believe all they need is a 40-year reputation. Good luck with that, I won't be back.
SIsk8-DkJPcye2gF6k4v2g	Sushi_Bars Japanese Restaurants 1_star	This restaurant would've received four stars because the chicken red curry was spicy and tasty, the happy hour cocktail was great, and the edamame was perfectly salted. And even though our server was a newbie, she was still attentive and got answers to all our happy hour and menu Qs. Unfortunately, none of this matters because I got food poisoning. I'm guessing from the chicken because no one else in my party got ill and I was the only one who ordered chicken. Worst 48 hours of my life. I'll never return.

IQUnUX12LvyhDI8SPKhnNA	Department_Stores Fashion Shopping 1_star	I like coming into this store. It's clean and always has great selection and deals. However, me and a friend of mine went late one night to shop and I ended up finding great deals. So I spent about $50 that night. I walked out and my friend asked what did I get. Well I didn't have everything in the bags so I went back inside to get it from the cashier. The first cashier or maybe she was a manager saw me and I told her I just walked out and noticed that I was missing items. She basically accused me of not telling the truth, gave me a dirty look like I was a thief and really didn't want help. So I made my way back to the cashier who also denied that she had the bag and again accused me of lying since I walked out. I think they felt I would make a scene which I would've because I was telling the truth and plus they were going to be closing within 15 minutes and there was a line! THEN giggling the cashier, she pulls the bag from the bottom shelf by her...she totally knew that she had it and she herself was lying. I have a feeling this isn't the first time they've tried this with people. So watch your bags! And I've worked in retail, really lame employees and actions that night.

Like most, I don't have a lot of time to spend on getting a pedicure so when I can carve out time I'm thrilled to get one done. I walked in with a friend, was directed to chairs for our pedis, and the gal working proceeded to work on my friend's toes while I sat without even water in the tub. waited and waited while a few ladies with appts showed up. finally after my friend was done she told me I had another 30 mins to wait. No apologies, no explanation... very frustrated and was incredibly disappointed with this rude and inconsiderate service. Obviously I left without a pedi as I didn't want to pay them a dime for anything.

K60lgoOHmHT_h9MddB33kQ	Mexican Restaurants 1_star	Not impressed at all. I went with my husband, and as always he ordered a bean burrito, it was very bland and way over priced. I had a chicken and a beef taco, the chicken was horrible, and the beef was very dry. For desert we ordered apple chimichangas which were very good, but how could you mess up deep fried apples and tortillas dipped in cinammon and sugar. The only thing good I have to say about this place is that every time I ordered a beer the waitress brought me one immediately and then about 20 minutes later the busboy would bring another out to me thinking I never received the first, either way, no matter how drunk I got the food never tasted good. I would never go here again.
xRJZEyO7LnbyOCgoenxJYA	Auto_Repair Automotive Car_Dealers 1_star	I took my BMW here because the dealership I purchased it from (used) took it here to have an oil leak repaired. First off, the oil leak was "repaired" only to find out later that it really wasn't. Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket, which either occurred when this shop put the part in, or they purchased it with the defect, but either way, the problem was missed on their part, which tells me they do not pay attention to detail. So, when we noticed the leak was still an issue, it was under warranty through this shop for the original work, so I took it back. I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley, they did repair it, however later that day my "service engine" light came on, then went off. A few days later, I parked my car, turned it off, and went to start it again after picking up my mail, and the car would not start. Thankfully, my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty), we towed my vehicle back to my house, which was only down the road, but it was dead. Come to find out, the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way, which is what tripped my "service engine" light a couple of days before, and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle, the vehicle finally wouldn't start. My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak), and there have been zero issues since. Now, I'm not sure if this shop did this on purpose, or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well. But, given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn't notice was defective or they messed up themselves, and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished, I am not very happy. On top of it, I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance!), and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son, and I were both sick at the time. I would NEVER recommend this shop to anyone, I will never ever go back, and I also intend on notifying the dealership I purchased my vehicle from of the issues in the hopes that they choose another BMW shop in the future to service any used BMW's that come onto their lot. What a complete and utter nightmare.
qfbnYmyNokLPoiXzEHMjaw	Shopping Drugstores 1_star	I hate this CVS with a passion. There are always people hanging outside begging for money. Sometimes, CVS allows these fundraiser groups to hang outside their door and ask you for money on your way in/out. I normally wouldn't care, but I'm not handing cash to a cheerleader to go to camp when there are children dying of cancer that could use the money more. Just saying. Anyway, back to the panhandlers. About a year ago, I was coming out of this CVS and heading to the bus stop. As I turned the corner, a guy approached me asking for money and before i could answer, he pulled out a knife. Luckily, I was able to run to the bus stop and the bus came right then. I was pretty shaken up because it was summertime and nobody was really around in that area (it was by the drive thru pharmacy). That evening, I decided to call the store and ask to speak to a manager to address their issues with people begging for money. Not only did I get an attitude, but the lady from the description of the guy that I gave her, seemed to know exactly who this person was (described him as a regular customer). She defended him by saying that it didn't sound like something he'd do. Um, excuse me? I was able to give her the exact time according to her that he is around CVS, a description, etc. Why would I lie about this? So a simple task like keeping panhandlers away was proven to be too difficult for CVS to handle and their managers could care less about their customers.
vC0WB73SpHiqB0YGOTKkww	Sporting_Goods Fashion Shopping Shoe_Stores 1_star	Unfortunately my first experience at Runner's Den wasn't good. The guy we had was so rude and in such a hurry, he had the shoes rung up on the register before I even had my old shoes back on! Maybe they were short staffed but you would think a Sunday at 1:30pm in the afternoon would be an OK time. They might be the best but not in service. I'll never go back but will keep on running!
GC-o6PdLKX_CLhvihFdp6A	Car_Wash Automotive 1_star	I had a whole review written and then IE crashed and I lost it but essentially, here's the gist: Don't go to this joint. It used to be decent to good..more towards the good. Now you bring your car in dirty and it leaves dirtier after they've used dirty, damp towels to swish the dirt around. Save your money,. I'm not sure where to go unfortunately because I can't seem to find ANY decent car wash in the valley anymore, but I can tell you not to bother with any of the Danny's car washes in the valley.
W8nr95-qIucyk3wbc2GGIg	Car_Wash Automotive 1_star	Customer service inside was decent...the people outside though weren't as nice. After my car was washed, they let it roll in neutral nearly hitting a wall. Guess they didn't realize it's a manual transmission. So after some guy jumping in and slamming on the brakes, he took it to start drying it off. As he was driving it to the drying area, he started driving it hard. After drying it off, another guy got in to park it. He was driving my car hard like a race car...just like the young man before him. I told him that I'd appreciate it if he didn't drive my car or any other customer's cars like that. He looked at me with a smirk and pretended like he didn't speak English. They obviously have no respect for other people's personal vehicles or opinions.
FBgC6f18eHdM6yQU147U1w	Car_Wash Automotive 1_star	Major suck. I have been here 3 times with three separate vehicles. I think "Hey? Why not try again?" Every time I get my car washed here I feel like they always forget something: the very bottom of your front and rear bumpers, the water that dripped from your liftgate onto the bumper, anything on the windshield that isn't dust...... I could go on and on, but my point is that they don't seem to care, they just want their tip and you leave. I feel bad so I tip, as it's hot and I sure as hell ain't doing the job. Go somewhere where your car actually comes out clean though.

E7c6aFeOyINUhtlxPxzdzA	Men's_Clothing Fashion Shopping Formal_Wear 1_star	I have been here on multiple occasions and each time the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Their selection in 38s-40s seems pretty limited. I've been twice now when I was looking for a particular color / style. When asked if I needed any assistance, the answer to "yes, I'm looking for x type of jacket in x color" should not be to say, "hold on a few minutes while I" do something and then to leave your customer waiting 10+ min for an answer. Save yourself the hassle and go check out, pretty much anywhere else. I hear they sell jackets and suits at the thrift stores. At least there I'm expecting to be ignored and have to fend for myself when trying to find something.

First of all, do not expect to make a quick 'in-and-out' experience. You walk in and put your name on the List.. yes, list with a capital L. What is interesting is they ask you what your question/comment/concern is but when you finally get called five hours later, they ask you to explain your question/comment/concern all over again. Let's just say you have a Blackberry Pearl 8130 and the roller ball does not work anymore. Hypothetically, of course. So the highly skilled guy behind the counter looks at it for 2 seconds and says "Oh, looks like it needs to be replaced..." I'm pretty sure I already said that. "Unfortunately, we don't have any of these in stock.." Wha? Come again? You don't have any more of one of your most popular phones in stock, in any of the 542 colors it comes in? Boy oh Boy. "Here, you can call this number and request they send you out a new one." Great, the same number that told me I had to go into the store to get it replaced. Oh brother what a bummer.

ZN_6n7XlS7sG7IlDc2cHYQ	Restaurants Italian 1_star	Last night we planned a special Valentine's dinner! We made reservations 2 weeks in advance so we would definitely have a table! It was a very important night for us and we went looking forward to a lasagne dinner! Unfortunately at 8:15 pm they were out! We were stunned, disappointed, and decided to settle for spaghetti! We did ask for the manager and he explained that they did not plan on so many wanting lasagne! Well the bread was very good! We had to ask for more and had to go find someone to get us some more butter! We mentioned this to the hostess who proceeded to tell us our waiter was new! After dinner when the manager wanted to know if we enjoyed. We told him.... not really... It was not what we wanted and $55 was pretty expensive for spaghetti! He asked so we told him what we thought! Oh my! He was rude, talking to us in a loud voice!!! Now we are getting mad but pay the bill and get up to leave at this point we just want to be gone! The manager is following us out and now he is yelling! We were very much shocked he starting yelling the F word. The doors are wide open and he does not seem to care that the entire place can easily hear him! He sees we are parked in handicapped right out front! Now he is yelling even louder about us illegally parking! Oh by the way the parking pass is extremely valid! This is a very unpleasant scene by the MANAGER! The spaghetti was definitely not worth it! Unfortunately I will never get to try the lasagne! Do not recommend at all!

AH_mzjAiJ2rcDGIDon4-gQ	Pizza American_(New) Restaurants 1_star	I used their catering services for a corporate training we were holding in our office. It was supposed to be delivered at noon. At 11:55, I received a call letting me know they were running a "few minutes" behind. Fast forward 35 minutes later, I am sitting on hold with them for 10 minutes trying to find out where our food is. The gal on the phone was rude and acted like I was out of line by asking where it might be. I guess I just assumed a chain as large as CPK would have their act together when it comes to these things. Instead they didn't offer an apology or ANYTHING. We definitely won't be using them for corporate catering again, or anything else for that matter.

They would prefer to assist clientele who are on the thinner / fitter/ younger side of life. Anything else they really don't have the attention span for. As witnessed on multiple visits. [Head Shake] Before I dropped a chunk of mass I ventured into this store. I would have spent the world and the moon that day. (The mgr of sales in training at my gym had sent me over to "invest" in protein what not.) I had a very specific product to purchase and a list of other "maybes". Yeah, this is before I started eating clean. Anyway, I had some questions. But the same very tall, dark haired lad, had to help a gal. With her cell phone. And then with mints. And some other critical stuff. I get it. Flirting. Sure, on the job. Go forth, do that. But when I finally had his attention, he had the audacity to be annoyed. At the actual paying customer. (vs. the gal that works next door and pops in all the time.) Hoy Vey. Kids. I get 'ya. But help the old ones with their wallets wide open next time. Periodically I would stop in there on my way to Sports Authority. To buy some energy bars. SAME THING. Then I changed my food vocabulary and never, ever, needed to go in there. DON'T GO.
qQa9zauNCqWWnkmCtVrbrw	Food Desserts American_(Traditional) American_(New) Restaurants 1_star	I was having lunch today with two business executives. I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad which seemed simple enough. When it was served I began to eat it and noticed there was no chicken. I politely asked if I had ordered wrong and she said "no" the chicken might be on the bottom. I checked, no chicken. I again brought it to her attention and she said she had to show the kitchen to be sure that I was correct. She then proceeds to take my salad that I had been tossing around to the kitchen . They go through it and she brings the same salad back saying "yea, you were right they forgot it, they laughed and added some for you". I would have thought they would have made a new one not played with mine and add chicken to fix it. I chose not to eat it after others have handled it. I didn't want take it further because I was with others. But.... Cheesecake, I was embarrassed enough for us all. Worst service ever! And an attitude I was shocked by! I sure the other people I was with will not return there anytime soon. There are a lot of great places to go at the Biltmore and Cheesecake if no longer one of our choices.

I have been attending the Wrigley Mansion for music on the patio for over a year now, and have been raving to all of my friends about it. All the stars happened to align this last Sunday, and ten (10) of my friends attended with me. I was embarrassed because it was no longer the same Wrigley. In two weeks (since I was there last), all the rules changed. The cool band, Delcoa, is no longer the band. There is no longer a $7 buffet. There remains half price bottles of wine, but they increased the price of the bottles. Um, excuse me, but if I am going to a casual event on an outdoor patio, why the hell would I buy a $90 bottle of wine (discounted to $45...ooh, what a bargain)!!!? I swear, even the outdoor lighting has been removed!!! And they have no Facebook presence where I might have been notified...nothing different on the website to indicate a "rebranding." They did still have a good crowd. I think the crowd follows the band, so all of these people were new to me. But they were not prepared. The service was very poor. (Remember, I was seated at a table of 10...Hello!!!? Cha Ching!!!?) It's likely I won't be back.
6rvAdrX73w3KoKP1wGho4w	Pet_Services Veterinarians Pet_Boarding/Pet_Sitting Pets 1_star	I flagged the "doctors" reply. It is filled with lies, as it would be. I have nothing to gain by making false statements. He has $$$$$ to lose if people heed my warning and avoid his practice. I have proof from THREE other vets that his diagnosis was WRONG. If my dog had blood in her eye, it would be there the next day, too. I took her to a chiropractic vet in AZ the next day. After adjusting her, he looked in her eye with an instrument. NO BLOOD. Plus, Bishop did not bother to look at my dog, or check her over in any way. NOTHING. NADA. He just announced very DIRE supposed concerns that required IMMEDIATE and EXPENSIVE procedures in HIS OFFICE, without any initial exam, or even listening to me about her history. All of this based on the fact that she was coughing. He completely ignored my every word. It is true she was knocked by a bigger (not huge, about 10 lb.) dog. Yet he ignored that, until his rebuttal now. He did not look at her little back or legs, etc., to see if they were sore or bruised,. After I took her to the chiropractor in AZ (who sadly isn't on Yelp, as he is expensive but SUPERB and worth every penny) she was much better. I also was concerned about the Flovent she was on and the Dr. in CA (who also checked her eye WITH AN INSTRUMENT unlike Bishop) said she was having a reaction to it. In Fact, Bishop said he knows NOTHING about Flovent and then ignored my concern about it. So it's odd he brings it up now. He just kept yelling how she's obviously in heart failure. It nauseates me that some vets do this to loving pet parents, esp. when their baby is getting older and they get more concerned. But as I said, as a rescuer, I'm a pro at this by now, and know when I'm being given a grotesque sales pitch. I give good reviews when they're warranted. I have NO reason not to. BTW, I'd been to the office of the "specialist" he was going to refer me to (read my review on the Vet. Specialists in Gilbert). NO THANKS. And the other "specialist" was at another office I'd been to. They wanted to put my dog UNDER (yes, anesthesia) to take a STICKER out of her leg. What? "Well, because poking with a needle, to pop it out hurts". Oh, so when you give a shot to a dog, you put them under for that, too? Obviously birds of a feather stick together.

I was also able to fill out all my paperwork online avoiding a long wait at the office. Arrive at 3:30 for my 3:45 appointment. The office was filled with screaming children. The receptionist needed my ID and insurance card. I had to fill out a quick consent form which was fine. 45 minutes later I'm summoned back to Dr. Kramer office. I waited another 10 minutes in there before his PA arrived. She then proceeds to ask me every single question that I already answered online which should have eliminated this long ass process. Finally Dr. Kramer arrives at 5:00. More questions, more examining. His conclusion was that I did not have a bacterial infection. I did however have a viral infection. He prescribed a Z pack. 4 days later and I feel exactly the same. I called his office yesterday and told them what is going on. I was then told that what he prescribed won't work because I did not have a bacterial infection and viral infections go away on it's on in about 6 weeks, but the Dr. needs to see you again. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????? I asked the lady what he was going to do different on my next visit that he didn't do on the first visit. No answer. Needless to say, I will not be returning to Dr. Kramer. If you simply want to give your money away I suggest an organization like PAWS (pets are worth saving) because Dr. Kramer ripped me off and had the nerve to try to do it a second time.

0ye3EKNb_ggG3vuEoDqxqQ	Seafood Restaurants 1_star	My bf was visting from Colorado Springs and we were in the mood for seafood, yeah in Phoenix, but we decided to try this place anyway. What were we thinking? There was nothing wrong with service, the food was terrible. It's definitely not what you expect when you look the price, really pricey. We shared oysters for the appetizer. I ordered a clam chowder. It was fine, not outstanding but edible. My bf ordered a ceasar salad, the plate was warm, the romaine was wilted. He is not a picky person but he did not hesitate to send it back. I ordered the scallops which were ok, a little on the rubbery side and it came with brown risotto. It was all too dry, I had to get an extra glass of water to wash it all down. It sat like a lump in my stomach, leaving no room for desert. My bf chose the mussels in an herb de provance soup. It was a bunch mussles that looked like they were swimming in yellow water. The taste? None, it was tasteless and watered down, no butter, no white wine, nothing to make it taste good. The herbs did nothing for the dish. Would I go back to give it a second chance, nah, not for the price. The most unsatisfying place I have ever eaten.
qUSdLLU8KjsyTa2brkqJPA	Wine_Bars Bars Nightlife French Restaurants 1_star	The place was pretty deserted...I discovered why. The inside has a slightly funky odor, like spoiled cheese and cheap wine. The owner was a sour faced jerk who demanded to know what I wanted. I'm assuming he was the owner because he had a European accent and his clothes were better than mine. And he had an aura of arrogance and authority. That's all it took for me to turn around and walk out the door. If all French bistros are like this one, then I'm steering clear of them in general. Sophie's really sucks.
ys23OVg673fZI2lLzjScSQ	Bakeries Food 1_star	Great cupcakes and cookies. Unfortunately - worst customer service in the world. It's a shame. Twice now, they have goofed up my cupcake order. No apologies for the mistakes both times. On one occasion, they completely forgot about the order. I was told I would just have to buy items out of the case - which I did. No problem. However, there were not enough cupcakes to fill the order and I was charged the full order price. When I pointed out that they had overcharged me by $9, the manager rolled her eyes at me. Started slamming things around and told me sharply I would have to WAIT for the refund. So you forget my order, don't apologize, overcharge for the replacement order, then have a hissyfit when I ask for the correct price. Wow. Unbelievable.
Iy8ggDf6-gOM6p-pTbysoA	Mexican Restaurants 1_star	I grew up with Manuel's. We used to go every Sunday after church growing up and that was back when it was still on 32nd St. Since I got older, the price has gone way up and the quality of the food seemed to go way down. Salsa isn't spicy anymore. Used to be that the plate was super hot when it was brought out to us, not anymore. One of the last times my family and I went there for dinner they charged us a 16% gratuity! 16% is way too high for any gratuity but we were only 4 people!

This 24 Hour Fitness location I started to feel ill after only 10 minutes of breathing in that horrible smell! Everything from the stationary bikes to the sanitizer dispensers are in disrepair.

Lja59qcfnkyiep-detRBFQ	Mexican Restaurants 1_star	Extremely disappointed. I have frequented this Rubio's for years. On my last visit there ever, I watched every second of the near Halloween horror: my carry out order was brought to another table, to an elderly couple who were obviously dining in. When the front counter guy asked if they were carrying out, they said they didn't care. I watched them open the carry out boxes. I watched them take the boxes to the salsa counter. I watched them take a bite from the boxes. I watched them shut the boxes when the counter guy realized that he brought them the wrong order when their order was finally ready and called out at the front counter. I WATCHED IN HORROR AS HE RAN OVER TO THEIR TABLE AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY RECEIVED THE WRONG ORDER, AND HE CLOSED THEIR BOXES AND BROUGHT THEM TO MY TABLE AND HANDED THEM TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was.....horrified. I was in shock. I said: um, I'm not taking that if they put stuff on it, and I know they put stuff on it and took a bite. The counter guy opened up the box and said, I don't see any stuff on it. it is fine. He closed the box and handed it back to me. Another customer walked passed me and I glanced at him in horror, hoping to get some kind of compassion and sympathy. He stared back at me with no emotion. I turned to the counter guy and said, I really don't want to take the boxes if they put stuff on it. He says, I don't see that they put anything on it. It's fine. And he laughed. It doesn't matter to me if he laughed at me or thought it was funny, but it was NOT funny. I walk out of the store DAZED and IN SHOCK with the two boxes. Never in my life, even in the dirtiest grossest restaurant have I blatantly experienced anything like this. When I got home, I opend the box to microwave the hell out of the plates thinking I would give it to my dogs; and there was a foot long hair EMBEDDED across both tacos which I slowly pulled out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! I can not even make this S*IT UP!!!!!!! I will never, ever go back there ever again. Good luck suckers. I hope you take your Cipro. You get what you pay for. Never ever again. The only plus was that it was free taco weekend, and the counter guy gave me a free taco, which I threw away after gagging pulling out the embedded hair. For years, the service was friendly and excellent. What happened? :( I'm on my way to Baja Loco.

jnoypMMyerb3RSaqywKvxw	American_(New) Restaurants 1_star	John S, I appreciate your interest in making people think T Cooks is a great place, and I also appreciate your attempt to get me back in to waste money. However, I just explained that your waiter was trying to run up the bill and your food was salty. And your response was "sorry...hope you come back.". Well sorry John S, not good enough. I am actively encouraging others to avoid your restaurant. At your prices, you should know better.
UafbyYAMP-qQlSHCFt7c9w	Food Sandwiches Bagels Delis Restaurants 1_star	I LOVE Einstein bagels. A LOT. Bet bagels I have had. We live right by this location and go there often but today was my last time I will go to this specific one. It is so dirty. I will give them a break that yes it was Presidents' Day so they were probably busy ... But there was trash on every table, all over the floor, the coffee bar area was disgusting, and the last straw was the gross bathroom. You can tell it had not been cleaned in months. There was so much grime on the sink and the paper towel dispenser I was majorly grossed out. It makes me wonder how clean the kitchen area really was. My order was wrong which Happens no big deal... On top of that I have never had good customer service there- next time I will drive the extra 10 minutes out of my way to the location on Tatum and shea's- they're always friendly and it's very clean there.
xWgfv5i4MDm3LjL7q903ZQ	Local_Services Jewelry_Repair Shopping Jewelry 1_star	ZERO stars. I brought my $600 Swiss army watch in as I needed to have a number placed back on the dial after a drop. Should have been a quick, cheap job. I jut picked it up and it looks like crap. There is excess glue all around the numbers, which they say "I have to live with". As I was making my case with the Asian lady who owned the place, one of the other workers was snickering in the background. Not only that, this simple job took 3 weeks to complete as they had to send it to California to fix because they did not have to tools to put the watch back together. Worst of all, the crown/pin was not attached properly and is loose. This place needs to be put out of business. Bottom line, Do not trust them with your jewelry even for seemingly simple jobs.
ZMxT6LWQq7gqlPY1IiGDSA	Flowers_&_Gifts Shopping Florists 1_star	Called and specifically asked if they could guarantee delivery between specific times on Valentines Day, once assured I placed my order. 15hrs later I get a voicemail asking if I could move the delivery to today and if so they would throw in a box of chocolates free of charge. After being put on hold for a total of 30min and hung up on twice they finally found my order and assured me that everything would be delivered today. Well the flowers were delivered today but no chocolates along with misspelled and misquoted words on the card. When you charge $15 for delivery I'd expect some level of professionalism. I will NEVER order from here again. STAY AWAY and order from 1-800-FLOWERS. I had wanted to support a local business but in this instance I will stick with a national competitor.
sHHQojJ9J6f0EPFvkjOglg	Veterinarians Pets 1_star	I used to go to Ingleside animal hospital for all my pets needs. I had a very sick kitty that they could not figure out what was wrong. The only option was exploratory surgery for an amount that was way out of my budget. I also didn't think my kitty would survive the surgery. They attempted to find every $!00 treatment they could over the course of several years. Never did figure out what ailed him. They got the money in the long run. Once my kitty needed some more antibiotics for an abscess that Dr. Serbin had already seen and prescribed for. The abscess came back. I had recently lost my car and my job and asked if they could just call a script in to a local pharmacy as i didn't have the $ for a cab ride or the visit. It had been 4 months since his last office visit and like i said they had seen this poor kitty dozens of times on deaths door over years. He told me it wasn't ethical to prescribe the meds that i needed to come in. I was irrate. I had just been in there for another cat 2 months prior and had a standing antibiotic script for him so I asked if they could call in the script for the other animal they had just seen. He told me that he wouldnt because he knew I would give it to the other animal. I ended up having to get my hands on some from someone else. otherwise my poor cat would have went without. I wrote a letter to them of how upset i was and got no reply. A few years later after trying many other vets and the sick kitty had passed away the other kitty I had needed a dental cleaning. I had saved adamantly to acquire the funds to get it done over 2 years. (its very expensive. In light of my experiences there I trusted their competency with doing the dental surgery so I returned back money in hand over $400. My anger from previous grievances were furthest from my mind had just about forgotten and just wanted my cats teeth cleaned. On the day of the appt because of my cats age they did pre blood work for the surgery and it came back he was diabetic. I couldn't believe it i had another cat that was diabetic and this one didn't show any of the signs i was shocked so they ran some more tests and loaded me up with insulin and never cleaned his teeth. My bill was just about all of the $400 i had desperately saved. Every time i gave the cat insulin his sugar would crash. I ended up going to a different vet (BLUE CROSS animal hospital) who eventually did the surgery and said that his mouth was causing his diabetes and he just needed it done. I suspect Ingleside purposely ran my bill up and didn't treat my animal because of past disputes. I have no proof but I will never pass on a chance to warn other cat owners to avoid them I will never return there and am so much happier with BCAC. I live in tempe now but will gladly drive to BCAC.
R53qUt6dQt_qFXncUPbdiQ	Day_Spas Hotels_&_Travel Beauty_&_Spas Event_Planning_&_Services Hotels 1_star	I stayed here for a conference. My diamond stud earrings went missing from the time my husband checked out to the time the room was cleaned. (He had seen them and forgot to grab them.) Estimated time of two hours in which the earrings were left unattended. He texted me when I was in the conference when he remembered seeing the earrings and notified security. The security person was cooperative and searched to no avail. I sat in the lobby for the Phoenix police. I asked for a comment card. I was told a survey would be emailed to me. No one from management met me. I am told that the employees are longstanding and have a lot to lose meaning their job if they stole the earrings. I asked if they polygraph employees. It is the police's decision apparently. My biggest disappointment is that no one from the staff reached out. At least four employees knew of my situation, did not say my name or offer a sentence stating they were sorry about the situation. It was though I was the problem although I had not accused anyone of anything. I have to file a report for insurance. One star goes to the security officer. He was professional, sensitive and empathetic to my situation.
8xNMHVfkB2zfl1_R9wk7Tg	Day_Spas Hotels_&_Travel Beauty_&_Spas Event_Planning_&_Services Hotels 1_star	This resort is beautiful. The grounds, pool, fitness center, and other amenities are amazing. If you are from snowy Chicago, Wisconsin, Minnesota and you want to getaway to beautiful Scottsdale AZ and enjoy serenity and comfort, you should consider Royal Palms Resort and Spa. Unfortunately, I had a bad experience at TJ Cooks restaurant for lunch. I ordered the flat iron steak and eggs. Except for the hash browns, the rest of the dish was INEDIBLE. I could have eaten a better meal at Denny's for a fourth of the price. I also ordered the Panini, a dessert combo of peanut butter, chocolate and bananas sandwiched inside a panini bread. This was also disappointing. My wife ordered the eggs sardou. It was cold and had no flavor but the hash brown potatoes were great. I'm hoping they had a substitute cook that day and this isn't their normal standard of taste. Again, you shouldn't miss the Resort, but I had reservations about TJ Cooks.
7-Ydn3GRoRIV1QQb88Btcw	Bakeries Food Desserts 1_star	In the world of cakes, there's somehow an unspoken rule that if it's pretty, it's okay to be subpar in taste and moistness. In my world, this does not compute. It needs to be as tasty as it is pretty. Period. So I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake, but nothing more. Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it... that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so. If you like the taste of fondant... you've got to be kidding me--Yucky! So take my review or leave it. I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second... less of course it's for a wedding, than it needs to be both EQUALLY. Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake? Not me. So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to me. Now, I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting. Frosting is secondary to me. So if you are more for frosting than for cake, ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine... no really, go ahead. If there IS frosting--for me and others like me, a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting... then BRING IT ON! I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake, I won't make it a point to get an inside piece, or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cake. Anyway, Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me. If I have to partake in one of her treats, I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake. As for MJ Bread, I have no complaints there... their breads really impressed. I can't remember which CenPho restaurant I had my first taste of MJ bread, but I remember being V E R Y impressed.

0KVFAEomSDisJ2SsIwVxUA	Food Desserts Delis Sandwiches Restaurants 1_star	Someone in class suggested this place and it was such a let down. A large group of us went and many people liked their sandwiches but my turkey cranberry w/ stuffing sandwich was awful. The stuffing looked like dog food and it tasted like cardboard and fennel. The cranberry sauce tasted like it came from a can and there was nothing special about the bread. The upside is we got our orders fairly quickly and the atmosphere was alright for a quick lunch spot.
2Kp4LODBxe1C1tL5lTJlPQ	Veterinarians Pets 1_star	Dr. Enrique Cruz is the most unprofessional person I have ever encountered. I rescued a nine-year old, 7lb dog from the Humane Society. Minnie was diagnosed with a Stage 3 heart murmur and the vet said she did not require medication. 30 days later, Dr. Cruz examined her and told me that her heart murmur was at 5.5-6 and required an Ace Inhibitor--$24 from his office. I called my local pharmacy and learned that I could buy it there for $4. I requested that he give me automatic renewals on the script--it is only 2.5 mg--because I have recently lost my job and health insurance and do not have the extra money for unneeded pet exams. When I got to the pharmacy, the script did not include renewals. I called the office and Stacey, the receptionist, said "don't worry about it, we will renew it at the end of the month." So, when I called back to get the renewal, Stacey told me that Dr. Cruz wanted Minnie to have lab work for $98 (he originally told me $198) before he renewed the script. I asked for what? She said, she didn't know. I re-explained that I am still unemployed and that when I find a job, I will bring her back in for an exam. Dr. Cruz got on the phone and immediately told me that he would not renew this script. As a health care professional for nearly 20 years, I asked him, "why do you need this blood work when this script is prevention....it will not cure a heart murmur?" He became angry and said that he did not want any liability. He further told me that my "unemployment status was not his problem." He said "I won't renew her meds unless you get the blood work. Sorry, I can't help you...".Then, he yelled, "get a job!!!!!" Then, he hung up! I called back and he answered and continued to scream at me. I asked again, what is the blood work for? He again refused to answer me and hung up once more. I am reporting his behavior to the Arizona Medical Examining Board. I have talked to two pharmacists and a doctor and all three told me that the script should have come with renewals for at least 90 days. I have been taking an ace for seven years and have a annual check up....my doctor gives me a six month supply. He is an ASS! He will only be friendly to you, if you can line his pocket.
gNgnZSJ6gEb0v6HsGb7iBw	Food Grocery Pizza Sandwiches Restaurants 1_star	This place is just as pretentious and uncomfortable as any uncomfortable and pretentious place I have ever had the displeasure of wasting my time and money. The food was boring, the service was unfriendly and almost non existent, parking was lousy, the food is overpriced, and the ambiance, if any, was drowned out by the incessant blaring music. This is the typical place where people with lap tops sit around discussing their greatest business and work ventures making sure everybody around them is, of course, aware how great they are and how cool they are. I don't recommend this place to any body that actually knows what good food is, what good ambiance is, and what good service is.

Postinos said they could do gluten-free before we were seated. Come to find out they could only do olives truly gf once they found out it was a true allergy. We were told by several different people that many items were gluten free; such as the sandwiches, but upon further questions about the meats, cheeses, etcetera being GF, they took back their reassurances. Close call to being poisoned!
vxDjGiQxUqMOZa6u5AJHkw	 1_star	Stopped in for a Bloody Mary on Sunday because Hazelwood's and Zipps were jam-packed. The neon sign on the place says "Darwin's" but apparently is known as "Famous Wings." Here's a "joke" from the bartender: "What's the worse thing about being a Packers fan? Telling your dad you're gay." Bash Packers' fans all you want, but "gay" is not a synonym for "stupid." Food was sampled and left mostly uneaten. Skip it!
XbMiiI8l7fNoRPeVamK7ZQ	Chinese Restaurants 1_star	WORST FOOD EVER!! I went there for their lunch specials and got the sweet and sour chicken. The egg roll was great, but the sweet and sour chicken was horrible. The sauce had no flavor and ruined my entire dish. Depending on your liking, the there were very thick peices of chicken within the dish with very little breading. I personal enjoy breading with my sweet and sour chicken.
n4zKBDfTqrHz9XIyY1bK8A	Breakfast_&_Brunch Restaurants 1_star	Blindly went to Taylor's with a friend on Sunday (had I known where we were going I would have recommended someplace else). I decided to be open minded and give them another try. I ordered an iced tea and the waffle, he got the poached eggs with hollandaise and a coffee. The server took our orders and returned with an OJ for me, forgivable offense - she took it away and brought me back a an iced tea. Then the incredible wait began... An hour later we finally flagged someone down to inquire on our food. He said he would check for us.. We never saw him again. There was a party of 3 and a party of 6 next to us, they both ordered after us and were almost done with their meal... Both parties were complaining about missing items, I overheard a bagel, a side of fruit and a waitress had all disappeared. At this point I was ravenous and we again went to find our server.. She finally brought our food, and it was horrible. The waffle was dry and tasteless and the poached eggs were drenched in hollandaise, thick greasy hollandaise that looked and tasted like it had been sitting on the plate for ages. Our horrible breakfast experience lasted 1:40 minutes. Ridiculous. I will not be returning, 3 strikes Taylor's you're out. I left a Yelp card on the table, hopefully they read this an make some improvements.
FXmERjlN6Ak8nJu7mNkm6Q	Breakfast_&_Brunch Restaurants 1_star	Literally one of the worst dining experiences ever. This restaurant is in our neighborhood and it looked so cute, I was very excited to get some breakfast and enjoy a beautiful day on their patio. We ordered after waiting for 15 minutes our waiter to even come to our table, we told him we were ready to order and he told us he would get us our drinks first. After waiting another 15 minute to get our ice tea, he finally took our order. Our food was brought to us by a women who looked like she clearly hated her job, she slammed the food on the table and walked away. As I went to take my first bite I noticed a long hair draped across my plate. ewwww. I could not find our waitress so I waited 5 minutes and had to flag someone else down, who apologized took my plate and walked away. Our waitress came back another 5 minutes later and asked where my food was, I told her what happened and she apologized and instead of offering to replace us, she told us she would get our check. wtf. I was blown away, I did not make a stink because I have worked in the service industry and I know you don't get anything when your rude.... but I wish I would have, because the owner or manager (I'm guessing)brought the bill and left a to go box for my sister. and that was that... they didn't even offer to replace my meal or comp it. This place is truly a joke, I will never go back.

vyUxxniOXnloJfDkgJNZoA	Thai Restaurants 1_star	So... I went to this place off of word of mouth for goo thai food. I took my 2 sisters and a friend. Tea was really good so I thought we were off to a good start. My sister started off with cabbage raps that were over salted and not good. We all placed an order for different things so that we can get a feel for the restaurant. I ordered a noodle dish.... they brought me a rice dish. I was trying to tell the waiter that the dish was wrong and they were very rude and would not help me at all. I attempted to waive down another waiter and asked for a manager and they told me that he would not come out. After that My 9 months pregnant sister was served her sweet chicken.. (now keep in mind she is a little less patience then normal in this last month so not so easy to please).. gets her food and it was cold and bland and dry. She asked for them to fix it and got push back so then asked if can then order something else. The waitress said yes and then took the order. 15 Min goes by and she asked what was the eta of her food and the waitress said that they manager told her that she sent her food back and that he was not making her anything else....... Crazy right! SHE WAS VERY UPSET, NOT ONLY DID THEY SAY THAT THEY WOULD BUT THEN THEY DIDNT EVEN TELL HER THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BRING HER ANYTHING ELSE. We asked to speak to a manager and then he came out from the kitchen and yelled at us to get out and leave that he will no longer serve us. I don't care how good the food is....THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. I HAVE WORKED FOR RESTURANTS AND HAVE NEVER HAD PEOPLE TREAT THERE CUSTOMERS THIS WAY!!!!!!
ilfy5z5o1twDbKIZLEODlw	Mexican Restaurants 1_star	Ok, I have to try to take this star rating of this place down a little. For the sake of those that pick a place based on the ratings, I think I owe it to them. I have lived by this place for years and always wondered why they hadn't torn it down because it was empty, and then one night the place was packed. I was very intrigued. And then when my husband described his receptionist declaring the reopening like it was a state holiday (with tears in her eyes) I thought "I gotta get me some of that!" We decided to go on an off hour on a Saturday and there was still a 45 minute wait. I liked the old inside, the no need to upgrade attitude was just my style. All of the anxiously waiting people and being right near the kitchen while waiting...I was screaming on the inside with excitement for the sure pleasure my taste buds were about to be hit with....and then we were seated. First, no alcohol. OK, this is a newly reopened place and may not have their license yet (darn I wanted a margarita!), oh well diet coke it is. They bring out a 6 oz cup of drink, a little syrup container of salsa (cute!) and a bowl of chips. I finished the drink in two sips, the salsa had no flavor, and I avoided the chips after the drink because I think the server was a blackbelt in avoiding interaction once the order was placed. The food came (and finally a refill, which I should have asked for no ice because the ignoring annoyed me the most) and we began to chow down. My husband got the chili relleno and I got the cheese enchiladas. My first bite I thought "hmmm this reminds me of that frozen crap my mom used to try to pass off on me" and I looked across the table to see my husband eyeing my food and his food barely touched. Now, my husband is an ex football player with a huge appetite that used to eat oysters out of a can in college, so that tells you something about his meal. Mine was edible and we shared with an overwhelming violated feeling . Surprisingly the server was very quick with the bill. I tried to talk my husband into not tipping but he is a gentleman. When I got home I began listing friends that I trusted their opinions to go and tell me that we are absolutely crazy (one of which likes Spam) and should give it another shot. The overall rating...bland, cheap and the salsa scared one of them (she described it like ketchup). Bottom line, don't be fooled like me. The place is no good and should have stayed closed (and I really wanted to like it!).

8zqUB0FuCtZ6KtH7DYXoFw	Fast_Food Pizza Restaurants 1_star	SO this is another request for a half star system on yelp or negative star on yelp for places like this. OK...so I ordered pizza 11:28p.m. Told me it would be there in 35 minutes that equals 12:03a.m. Actual delivery 12:38a.m. AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got bone out Barbecue Wings and Apple Pies! I know not the healthiest food in the world but fuck I was hungry and there commercial came on. The unfortunate part about those two items is that they were both cold. I know for a fact that if your pizza and order from Pizza Hut shows up 5 minutes after it promised time it is free. I asked for my free stuff from the manager on duty (GERALDO) aka deuschbag! He was like that is not a policy but I know it is in any event pizza hut is the most expensive pizza delivery place so I payed like $24.00 for cold food. Did you know that the drivers only get .97 cents out of that $2.50 delivery fee...sucks for them I usually tip fat...this guy got my change!!! This sucked I am going to see if I can get another place to deliver to me.!!

obyZikDniHWdJljYytltPg	Mexican Event_Planning_&_Services Venues_&_Event_Spaces Restaurants 1_star	This is the single worst restaurant I've ever been to, anywhere. From the looks of the other reviews, I must have caught them on a bad night, but I swear to God, the tacos I had there tasted like spoiled meat. My friend and I couldn't stomach more than one bite each and were not satisfied by the restaurants lack of concern over our complaints. We were made to pay for inedible food and no attempt was made to make things right... And for the record, I've got no problems with 'real' Mexican food-- street vendors and the worst Mexican joints I've been to from LA to Ensenada to Cozumel, are all better than this place.
yBKNl52OwyO_IKYpPgoi1g	Mexican Event_Planning_&_Services Venues_&_Event_Spaces Restaurants 1_star	This is a difficult one, because I use to love Aunt Chilada's. So here's what happened yesterday. My family decided after much talk that we wanted mexican food, so I suggested AC, because even though I haven't been there in like 3 years, I us to love the food and service. When we arrived around 3pm, we notice that there were hardly anyone there, my husband thought that was strange. We decided to sit inside because the outside looked pretty lonely. The guy at the door directed us to the right of the restaurant, there were one group of two ladies, that were leaving and us... so we wait, and wait, and wait... then a group of about 4 people sat down, and we still waiting... I notice that we didn't even have water, we looked around and there were two girls sitting to what it looks like the back area, complaining and talking, I know cause they were loud. Out of know where comes this waiter and completely bypass us and went straight to the table that came after us... My husband looked at me got up and we left... that's when the waiter said hi... it was so bad. What I also noticed is how dirty this place is, the fixture have pounds of dust, everything is dusty and looks dingy, so my though was, what is going on here, my husband responded, if this place looks this bad, I wonder about kitchen... sad, so sad, WHAT HAPPENED TO AUNT CHILADAS...WE ARE NEVER COMING BACK. Down the street is Los Reyes de la Torta, is on a little strip mall, but the place is clean, service is impeccable and food was amazing... at least something good came out of all this.

I was quoted a price to repair and upgrade my computer. It was NOT done as promised later that day nor 2 weeks later! He had me pick it up at his house and still my computer was not upgraded and he lost my power cord and "rigged" one up for me with black tape...Still waiting for the upgraded memory card he promised and my new card that I have NEVER RECEIVED..PLEASE stay away from this place!

efSjJdusA8fOeryscVy5vA	Breakfast_&_Brunch Restaurants 1_star	Horrible service! Our waiter took 25 minutes to greet us and the busser apologized 3 times. The busser was great but you could tell very frustrated. I tipped the bus boy $20 just to make a point to the waiter and manger that the bus boy needs to replace the waiter. Steak fries came and were uncooked. Kathy the manager was very nice as well and could tell I was disappointed in the place. Spend the extra money and eat at the restaurant up top of the resort. The only reason we came here was because we were with kids and thought this would be more appropriate.
HjmSSiaiUogGeRI-Foxoqw	Italian American_(Traditional) Mediterranean Restaurants 1_star	The view for this place is nice and their food tasted not too bad but the price just doesn't justify what you get. They have some of the smallest portions I have ever seen for a pretty penny. The waiter I had was a bit of a prick and I was forced to pay him basically a 40% tip. I dined in a party of 6 and they add a service charge on top of a 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. It's ridiculous and so not worth going to. I'm from LA so seeing overly priced food with so so service doesn't get high marks from me. I won't be coming back. You're really just paying for the view. I am so disappointed with this place.
rEUPLTxS-OhTOJ_6LmKCcg	Mexican Restaurants 1_star	I don't know folks. I see a lot of good reviews of this place here on Yelp but my experience at this restaurant was just awful! This is your typical mom and pop place. Normally these types of places are great. Not so with this one. We walked in and were seated promptly. We had a couple of questions about the menu and our food server could not answer any of them. One of the questions was "do you have margaritas"? She was so clueless she didn't even know if they served margaritas or not!!! Every question we asked she kept having to run into the kitchen to have answered. Finally an older lady had to come out and help her. The older lady told us our food server had only been there a week. You're there a week and don't know what type of drinks you serve among other things? The items we ordered were guacamole cheese crisp, shredded beef burrito enchilada style (red sauce) and machaca burrito with green sauce. The cheese crisp was cold and the tortilla they used had the consistency of pop tarts. Hard, greasy, horrible. It was the worst cheese crisp I've ever had. The shredded beef burrito was only filled about a quarter of the way and the beef was extremely dry and flavorless. It makes me nauseous thinking about it it was that bad. The machaca burrito was made using ground beef with spices. Not your typical machaca. We thought we were given an incorrect order but the food server advised us this is how they make their machaca. It is dried then ground. I would not visit here again. I've eaten at better Taco Bells. Do not eat at this restaurant.
i_QLERLM2i3yAo4JXVrAcQ	Local_Services Pest_Control 1_star	I liked that they offer respray if you find critters within 21 days of spray, but after 3 months of service, have had to have re-sprays EACH month. Paying extra to treat for scorpions and there are now scorpions galore and worse than prior to exterminating... And to make matters worse, they give a 2-3 hour window to be home and twice now, have not met that window or bothered to call to let me know they were not going to make their time slot, leaving to to reschedule and play the "wait around for the bug guy" all over again. Do yourself a favor and find a more reliable company.

Otherwise the place pretty much sux. The food is mediocre at best. The vibe is lame. The worst part is that they do karaoke there alot, and it is loud and obnoxious. This place has pretty much run it's course. Time for it to close and re-open as something else. Hopefully under new ownership. And minus the karaoke.

I have yet to be contacted by anyone about being hung up on, not even by email which I sent nearly 14 hours ago...... Well guess what scum bags - you cannot delete this.

Take out containers barely 3/4 full. I would welcome to discuss my thoughts with new owners as I am NOT the only one who believes this. My neighbors have the same feelings on the recent downfall of this once neighborhood favorite.

I bought a set of tires with a hazard warranty and the tires began to split. The tires were manufactured by Firestone. I researched Firestone tires and they have had major lawsuits and Ford actually dropped them as a supplier just last year. Firestone had been with Ford for 94 years. Fletcher would not cover my tires which I purchased less than 2 1/2 years ago because of the splitting of the tire. I will NEVER buy another tire from Fletcher and neither should you.

PMMK7HSjVAkxT3upGbHhWg	Pet_Services Veterinarians Pet_Boarding/Pet_Sitting Pets 1_star	Incompetence and Lies - I just moved to Phx and needed to find a veterinarian, groomer, and boarding facility for my dog. After searching the Internet and reading hundreds of reviews, I booked an appointment at DCAH for vaccinations and grooming, plus a tour of the boarding facilities. We arrived early and were taken to an exam room, where a technician performed the standard temperature and heart rate exam, etc. We were told to wait for the vet, who would be in to administer the shots. Thirty five minutes later, I went back to the front desk to inquire as to whether my dog could still be groomed, since the vet was running late and we were now 20 minutes into the grooming appt. The front desk staff asked for my name and whether we were in an exam room!! They apologized profusely, stated they were running behind, and the doctor would be in to see us shortly. We returned to the exam room, and an older technician with long red hair came in to apologize again and to tell me that there had been a "surgical emergency" that was keeping the doctor, but that the doctor would be in within 5 minutes. Note that she did this with a straight face. I asked her to find out how long the grooming would now take, as I had other plans for the afternoon. She returned to tell me I could leave my dog and pick him up around 3pm. I advised her to cancel the grooming, as this was not acceptable. If they can't even keep track of who is waiting to see the vet, do they honestly think I am going to leave my precious pet in their care? The vet did arrive approximately 5 minutes later, and asked if I had been told what happened. I advised that the staff explained there had been a surgical emergency. The vet said "No, there was no emergency." The vet advised me that the initial technician who was supposed to notify her that we were waiting "dropped our paperwork" and therefore never told her we had been waiting, now for 45 minutes. She did a 30-second once over on my dog, administered the shots, and inquired as to why I had told the front desk to forgo the grooming. I explained that I did not want to wait until 3pm for him to get a bath and haircut, and would not leave him unattended. The doctor seemed genuinely sorry for the problem (as I am sure she hates seeing potential long-term customers bolt for the door due to the incompetent support staff and doesn't like finding out they are liars.) She offered to have a technician give my dog a quick bath and nail trim for free as compensation, but I declined. She was very insistent that she wanted to compensate me somehow, so I agreed to allow her to clip my dog's nails for free, thinking she would do it herself. She directed me to the front desk to checkout,where I was charged $46 for an "exam" that really didn't occur and another $75 for three shots I could have obtained elsewhere for a third the price. To top it all off, a technician behind the desk again "apologized" for the emergency surgery that had delayed the vet, another lie. Yet another technician then came out with my dog, at which point I learned that the vet had not personally done his nails. Had I known he was being passed off to this support staff, I never would have let him out of my sight. There was a time when I would have demanded that these two lying technicians and the veterinarian stand together and offer an explanation as to why they think it is acceptable to not tell the truth to their paying customers. As I've grown older, I've learned that it does no good to confront a liar; some people just don't have any qualms about looking into my eyes and lying, and nothing will ever change them. Now, I let my money do my talking. Speaking of which, they didn't even have change when I tried to pay my bill with two one-hundred dollar bills. Really, a business that large without $74 change on a Saturday afternoon? May God help the poor animals entrusted to the care of these people; mine will certainly never be one of them.

It's convenient that there's a wells fargo in there, but there's one across the street as well. To the negative experience..... My sister was speaking to my niece, but not in english. Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says, "Can't you speak english?" WTF?!? Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands? It's like you're trying to make every race hate you even more. I will run into this arrogance wherever I go. I'm not done yet. Keep on reading.... My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine. We know you have to be of a certain age to play it. One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she can't play it. Calm down. Kids are just innocent and don't need this extra verbal abuse in their lives. Don't you have something better to do like restock the shelves? Swear... Racial profiling.
2g8tKDPDrrYRNmkPpQMzow	Tires Automotive 1_star	what is it with my luck paying money for services that fail to fix my problem? I went in to Big O Tires after seeing an advertisement on their window for an A/C check. After driving around 2 wks in a hot as hell car I said enough is enough and gave them a call to diagnose the problem. I was told that I was almost a pound low on freon and sent on my way. Yay! Cheapest option, right? Wrong. So very very wrong. Unfortunately I dropped by an hour before closing so I'm guessing I was rushed out while they were closing shop. They either never checked the air coming out of my vents for themselves or they KNEW they were ripping me off $150. As I pulled into my driveway 15 minutes later my car was no cooler at all. Next day I book it there to see what they could do since I just dropped some cash there. "Come in Saturday and my A/C guy will take a look." Fine. Come Saturday I'm praying for a leak somewhere. Hey! I paid $15 for flourescent dye! It better prove useful. 30 minutes later and I'm told it is low. "So it leaked since Monday?" I asked. "Monday?" "Yes. I brought it in Monday and paid for an evac and recharge." He had no idea. Smell something fishy yet? So he takes it back again and looks it over finally coming back to say he was wrong about it being low (REEEEEAAALLY FISHY) and it is either one of two parts. I was referred to a shop for them to check as they couldn't do it there but they couldn't refund me for the evac and recharge. However I could have this shop do the repairs and Big O wouldn't charge for the second evac and recharge that would have to be done on my car. First off... nobody would let someone leave their shop after doing work only to have someone else finish the job. WTF. So here I am now spending a grand for a new A/C today when $29.95 was supposed to diagnose this a week ago. If you are feeling charitable, at least pick a more honest organization to throw your hard earned money at. Now if you excuse me, I have a district manager to write.

qqp1sPc5-cYYZQVdxnPcRg	Doctors Health_&_Medical Obstetricians_&_Gynecologists 1_star	My issue is with Dr. O'sullivan. She's straightforward, no sugar coating, no emotion, no small talk, just strictly to the point. That's usually not my go to type of doctor but besides the personality factor I didn't have any other reason to switch at the time. I guess I should have gotten worried when she prescribed Zoloft for me because I was "depressed". I've never been treated for depression nor had any other doctor ever bring it up. I was young, unmarried, still in school and pregnant with horrible morning sickness. Would you be thrilled? I did not take the Zoloft, which now has a huge law suit for birth defects! She also wanted to give me zofran for my morning sickness which I refused to take as well. I went into labor at the hospital at 8pm and dilated until about 4 am that morning. Dr. O'sullivan didn't show up until almost 6am. My daughter sat in the birth canal so long that when she was born she was not breathing. My heart dropped when I didn't hear my baby crying. What did the doctor do? Nothing! Absolutely nothing. She stood there looking so confused. The nurses ran the baby over to the table and called a code. Other nurses literally ran in and revived my daughter getting her to breathe. Dr . O'sullivan did not even touch my daughter once while all that happened she just watched. If it wasnt for the amazing staff at good Sam my daughter would not be here or may have had long term effects. Even worse is that the same thing happened to my cousin. Dr O'sullivan was her OB and took a very long time to show up at the hospital as well. My cousin had already had two children so she knew the risks of waiting and told the hospital she's not waiting anymore so go get the doctor on staff. The dr at the hospital delivered her baby with no problems but just imagine if she had waited for Dr. O'sullivan to show up what could have happened.

You are a manager and your first inclination when a customer asks if you have an item in stock in the back is to say you're probably out? I know how you work Whole Foods. I know how disorganized (and usually filthy your back rooms are) and you all like to act like you can't do anything if something is out on the shelf. I would think if you are going to overcharge for a "bunch of junk" (in the words of John Mackey, CEO) then you could at least offer excellent customer service. But, no. Oh well. I will find the item elsewhere and I won't be back. Every time I'm at Trader Joe's or Sprouts they are super helpful, and refuse to let me leave unhappy. Whole Foods could care less.

ANUcrto9RLGMTaqdaY9r3A	Burgers Pizza Sandwiches Restaurants 1_star	They ripped us off! They placed a Val-Pak electronic coupon in which if you buy $40 worth of food, you receive a $10 credit. We ate our dinner, received our check, gave the electronic Val-Pak coupon with code and scan symbol and the Manager refused to honor it, saying the owner instructed him not to, and it had to be printed out. Nowhere on the coupon did it say that it had to be printed out and again it contained the OCR scan symbol and an alternate code for the cashier. They called the Police Department on us! Even the Manager acknowledged that it was misleading but his "hands were tied" by the owner. Bad experience.....left a very bad taste in our mouth about this owner and his business and we will never return. I do also see several other reviews on this place that comment on the owners poor behavior towards his employees, and failure to make good on his "special offers". I do also remember when the sandwiches in this place contained a lot more steak, and were considerably less expensive. The value has definitely gone downhill and it in my opinion the owner is getting more and more negative and hardcore in his attitude towards his customers and employees. Very disappointed in the downward turn.....
rnDGwXmsSzbdvTXgNq4jOA	Bars American_(Traditional) Nightlife Restaurants 1_star	Im only giving 1 start because I can't give 0. The waitress was pleasant and extremely helpful, but not dressed appropriately. The Food was inedible. We ordered a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich and a Steak&Fries. The sandwich was bland, the cottage cheese tasted rancid, and the fries were way overdone. We ordered the steak medium rare, and it came well done, tough, and smothered in pepper (no other flavor at all). When we sent it back, the replacement was Raw inside, and grey. We did not feel safe eating it. The manager comp'd the steak (but not the fries!) and we were not thrilled but then it got worse. As we were towards the end of the (spectacularly disappointing) meal, a live baby roach ran across my fiance's plate. This is unacceptable and I will be reporting this place to the AZ Department of Health

What I wasn't told was this place operates like a used car lot. There is an "up" system and you are basically treated like a piece of meat. The sales person was very pushy and made me feel like I was obligated to make the purchase there because of the time that I spent with them. The prices were average when compared to the other locally owned independent stores. I was basically almost strong armed into putting down a deposit. It takes me a lot to write negative reviews but I am hoping this review will help prevent this experience from happening to someone else.

An overly enthusiastic plain clothes (cop?) with a picture of a badge on his cell phone accused my contractor, and friend of theft (and later changed his tune to say fraud). With a receipt in his pocket for the roofing materials that he 'stole' that this private dick refused to look at aggressively cuffed him and shoved him around to the back room and interrogated him for well over an hour before Phx Police came on site. His shoulder was hurt, the cuffs were on so tight circulation was lost in his hands, and all the while a full paid receipt for all the goods was in his pocket. Right before the police arrived he finally looked at the receipt and said "Its from yesterday you thief!! You lying thief!!" This date on the receipt was Sept 5 2013. Guess what day it was....Sept 5. Now, the rentacop changes his tune and said " I never said you stole, you are committing fraud" Once Phx PD was on site, they quickly realized that there was no crime, no theft, no fraud and demanded my contractor be released, which he was. But he continued to be harassed and threatened by this guy. they also tried to keep my roofing materials, which the PD wouldnt let them do. I just bought a house down the street. I am remodeling it starting with the roof, then the paint, then the flooring, then the bathrooms. I was set to spend 30-40k at this store in the next 3mos. now, that money is going to Lowes on FLW down the street. They screwed up bad. I have also offered the services of my (very good) attorney to my contractor, and that ball has started to roll. This went well beyond normal detainment/suspicion and civil action will be prompt.
wM_mtZvc95dYomxSXycUbA	Greek Mediterranean Restaurants 1_star	Noticed the Big WORLD'S FAMOUS GYRO sign out front. walked in, very nice and friendly staff. awesome service. Unfortunately the gyro I got was really soggy, the meat and sauce was everywhere, not fresh, and the bread had a very distinct burnt taste to it. The fries were gross... I don't know what went wrong with this place, but it was packed out with people eating awesome looking salads.... I guess I ordered the wrong thing
Bcqvs1EbLFUAnMIeWMe_MA	Pet_Services Pets Pet_Stores 1_star	Went to get my dog's food at the Pet Food Depot (Cave Creek/Grovers) and I saw a bunny in a cage on the floor, scared. He/she had food and a carrot but no water. I told an employee and after a bunch of "that's not my rabbit" comments, finally someone gave the bunny water. The sweet young man who checked me out told the manager that a customer wanted to buy 2 parakeets. The manager said to put them in a paper bag because they're out of boxes...really, a paper bag? The young man said the customer specifically wanted the birds in a box and the manager said "we don't have any boxes, should I grab one from the sky" and walked off. What a huge turn-off! I found out that the manager is the owner's son. I have been coming here for 8 years and this was my last trip here. There is a store a little further away (Western Ranchman at 32nd St/Paradise) that sells the same specialty dog food I buy, so they will be getting my business from now on. I have always been treated well here but after the flippant comments from the staff in front of a loyal customer, they obviously do not care about me or the animals they sell.
9TeX9pPiZbQ43X0PLZIwnA	Optometrists Health_&_Medical Shopping Eyewear_&_Opticians 1_star	Wondering if the two pair deal is too good to be true? It is. I went in on a Thursday afternoon. Two people were working and there was only one other customer in the store. One employee greeted me and then returned to he desk to play on his cell phone. I shopped for about a half hour trying on frames and finally left because no one would help me. The moral of the story: no one will help you if you are standing by the $79 frames.
90IP8GHnY8HUo48nSl3P3Q	Restaurants 1_star	Was there awhile back. Food was just average. However the reason for my 1star review- On my way out i ordered a piece of chocolate cream pie to take out. When I got home I opened the box and inside was a dried up piece of pie. Literally. I put my fork into the whipped cream and the entire whipped cream came off in one piece. Underneath the chocolate was dried and cracked. It was the consistency of something that sat for 2 weeks in an arid place. Im not making this up. The pie had to have been a couple of weeks old. What bothered me though was that waitress HAD to have known the pie was old. The staff HAD to have passed it several times over the weeks. I was floored. I threw it out cause it was too late to drive back there. Da did they think I wouldn't notice! Will never go back there because that wasn't just a mistake. They didn't want to loose money so they sold me it to instead. And they are famous for their pies. What a laugh
MLXUK3K_WMQhrW2_JTVvDg	Car_Wash Automotive Gas_&_Service_Stations Oil_Change_Stations 1_star	They put packing tape on my brand new car! It doesn't have pieces blowing in the wind, so the tape was unnecessary and left adhesive on the paint around the back wiper and the tire cover. To add insult to injury, it took nearly half an hour even though there was no line, and the employees let the car dry completely before they pretended to wipe it off, so there were water spots everywhere. They also didn't even attempt to wipe off the adhesive from the tape. It seems reasonable to expect that your car will be cleaner after a car wash than before, but not at this place.
UXCFPYwBI7d16T1Cb9mDHA	Fast_Food Restaurants 1_star	Yesterday evening I went thru the Drive Up window and experienced the most rude behavior from a female employee...I will not frequent that place ever again
gbJtQuRVLThyf_rmrV9qyg	Beauty_&_Spas Nail_Salons 1_star	horrible customer service. waited 20 minutes to get my eyebrows done as a walk-in. they kept telling me just two minutes. they took 6 people ahead of me. so i stood up a collected my keys and wallet from the chair next to me and they didn't say a word so i just walked out. and there was dust everywhere. will never go back! if i could post no stars, i would.
sPrKHAXJ7tr-6pPnPYQlNA	 1_star	Waited long enough in line to write this review with 15 min extra to spare. Oh, yeah. There is no line. I'm just standing here at the counter with cash in hand as every employee here wonders around aimlessly. Use the oreilly's auto parts across the street.
LvK6JaM9L4YqUPz11PIahw	Mexican Restaurants 1_star	I have been a customer for over 12 years, but the place has been on the downhill slide for years. They closed the location on indian school years ago, for the same reasons. Those reasons are many now. I stopped back in after being away from Julio G's Take out. Had 2 beef tacos and rice.... The rice is very plain and has gotten more gringo over the years which equals bland. The taco's had a nice shredded beef filling and was better than 2 years ago. But the salsa bar has been reduced to salsa given out on plastic topped cups. Bad news is you have to ask for more all the time if you like the sauce, the hot is far from hot any gringo can use it. Bad news one person taking orders during lunch service in take out and service said orders. Cleanup needs to be focused on here... They have forgotten to do this. Yes, a long term customer is seeing another location in slow spiral down the drain.
ckcqQ42fKJK7Nc5_SXt1qQ	Food Sandwiches Bagels Breakfast_&_Brunch Restaurants 1_star	Usually out of bagels by 10:30. Went up the street to Tatum and Shea and even though it was packed they had every flavor bagel. Won't be coming to this one anymore.
5Ow8nFSepqrelOGmwIgdWQ	Health_&_Medical Home_Health_Care 1_star	Their is nothing lower than one star or even negative. Where to start? FOOD- NOT GOOD, the staff specially Miriam is SUPER NICE(GO TO THE DINNING ROOM, FIRST FLOOR) CLEANLINESS-Over the surface cleaning and the common areas, usually the first floor. Cover your nose if you go to the second floor! CARE-2 girls (TOTALLY WORTH IT) out of at least 30 i have met. HORRID ODDS not to mention that they have 15-25 patients to 1 nurse. And they split patients from one wing to another on the other wing of the building. WHAT? Really! When I ask how my dad is doing; NO ONE KNOWS! It's usually a I just got here, or a plain "I don't know". Don't they have charts? BATHS- Dogs gets better and more loving baths, I SAW it since I was in the bathroom/bath area. INJURIES: Just NEVER heals, goo on top of goo. ACTIVITIES: I gotta give it to the lady in charge of that she does A TON if the residents want to join. OVERALL: Think about how you would want you mom or dad to be taken care off. And if you are a selfish person and you don't care about your parents. KARMA IS A B#&^!(@ So good luck when you get old! I sure know why I am not a Doctor, Economist, Mechanic, Arquitect to name a few... it's cause I SUCK! Why choose to be in a field like this if you are not CUT for it? I am sure you can go somewhere else and make $10 an/hr! Looking for a different location currently! WHAT A SHAME this PLACE is OVERALL. The 4 people i have met are not enough to make this location worth while anyones time! If you want to get back at your parents, or a friend PUT them here! They might keep them alive... BUT that's about it! Most of the people here are not terminal! They are just old, and have no one to look after them around the clock. They are here to have someone help them with basic needs and maybe show a bit of love while they are here.
01wkBSvayjaB6SLrip7UIA	Auto_Repair Automotive 1_star	My family has been going to Cathedral for all of their automotive needs for a few years, faithfully. But after hearing how they bilked my Mom today, none of us will be going back. After she had her 30,000 mile service yesterday ($235.00) she noticed that her A/C was not working when she left. She called Cathedral and they told her to bring the car back in. So, today she brought it in and was told that there is a hole in the A/C hose. She explained that it was working fine when she brought the car in and did not understand why this had happened. Should't testing the A/C be part of the service? Or maybe they could have told her that she was low on freon? Or that the hose was bad? NO, the guy told her that this was a common thing with her make of car. They told her that it would be $150.00 for the part. That $150.00 turned into $313.00 when they were done and now my Mom who is 75 and on Social Security will have to do without, because these guys f'd up. Thanks Cathedral...for ripping off a old lady.

hn2hL_VcWjqOkW27-XI_FQ	Sushi_Bars Japanese Restaurants 1_star	I'm literally yelping 10 minutes after leaving this place because it really blows ass.... This is even bad by shitty strip mall sushi standards. I wanted to make it my neighborhood cheap sushi place (cuz its nice to have a cheap sushi place where they know you and you know that its not gonna be great but it'll do when you want sushi and dont wanna spend too much), but this ain't it.... First off, I have a thing about filling out the stupid fucking check sheets all cheap, shitty sushi bars want you to fill out. NUMBER ONE, THEY HAVE ALL THE NAMES THEY MADE UP OF ALL THE SHIT THEY MAKE BUT NO EXPLANATION OF WHAT THEY ARE! WHAT THE HELL IS A SUNSHINE ROLL ANYWAY? So, I sit down, introduce myself with a smile and ask the name of the sushi guy. I explain that I'd rather just have him tell me whats fresh and explain what kinds of things I like and would he mind just taking care of if. Simple enough in a empty goddamn sushi bar right? NO!!!! He basically tells me, if you don't fill out my stupid fucking directions, I'm not smart enough to prepare you sushi. Not wanting to be a complete butt hole and stand up, leave and go to Yasu where they have a clue (a decision I am now regretting) I smile, fill out the sheet and wait for what I expect, the same ol shit you get at every strip mall sushi bar in the country..... To cap it off, my girl and I had one cocktail each, a total of 2 nigiri orders and 4 rolls...... IT WAS $100 DOLLARS.... I HAVE NO PROBLEM SPENDING EVEN TWICE THAT MUCH. BUT FOR A CRAP VERSION OF STRIP MALL SUSHI??? NO WAY... THIS PLACE JUST BLOWS... NOT A JAPANESE GUY EXISTS WITHIN TWO BLOCKS OF THIS PLACE...THE CLOSEST JAPANESE GUY IS TWO BLOCKS AWAY AT YASU. HELL, THERE ISNT EVEN A KOREAN GUY IN THIS PLACE.... RIDICULOUS....
qnq42VNsJhcmUxTTVj5VCg	Fast_Food Restaurants 1_star	I feel bad for the low rating b/c the lady who works the drive thru late nights has been there since my hubby & I were in HS & she is super sweet but ugh, I GOT FOOD POISONING HERE! It was 1am Christmas day, or the day after if you wanna get technical, and we were all hungry after some drinking & other 'festivities". Jack in the crack is 1 of the only places by us open 24 hours, so the boys went on a food run. That morning at about 5am I got so sick. I thought maybe it was the alcohol but I only had 2 glasses of wine & 1 glass of champagne, nothing crazy. When I couldn't stop throwing up that entire day, had the chills & body aches, my husband said it had to be food poisoning. I will never eat here again, or at least for a long time, no matter how hungry at 1am I am. All the pain I was in was not worth it!
A1jpc9h9uUp7NcL1_Xe_4g	Chinese Restaurants 1_star	I read the other reviews, I don't see how they earn a three star. Maybe their attitude change for the worest; maybe its the summer heat, In my book that owner lady is definately NOT FRIENDLY !!! she is a bitch !!, she brought out the wrong oder, we took a few bit before we realizing it was not what we ordered, she insisted we pay for it anyway - because we already eat it (three bits worth). The man is nicer, he came out and take care of our complain. The food is pretty much like other Americanized chinese restaurant. - Cheap and plenty. As for me, I won't be back here again; plenty Other good Chinese restaurant to choose from.
I3W6Krux64rfsxsRHtf3WQ	Japanese Restaurants 1_star	This was some of the worst sushi I've ever had, especially for the money. I could barely get it down. The place is dumpy and depressing inside. All around terrible.
W1c2w06Q1RnT3OPUDb-ZOw	American_(Traditional) Restaurants 1_star	We ate at Rennick's restaurant, with some eager anticipation because we were hungry and the menu looked decent, and it was our only option (nothing else within walking distance of hotel). We sat outside in the lovely and peaceful courtyard by the fountain. The waitress was very earnest and sweet. I ordered a Tuna MELT with sweet potato fries. Everything on the plate was cold, though the plate was warm. There was a sprinkle of cheese on the top that looked like it was broiled for 20 seconds to brown, but even that was cold. I asked the waitress to have them re-heat the sandwich, and maybe put a little more cheese on the top. She returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries. She told me that the chef said 'that's how the sandwich is supposed to be'. She even came out with another waitress that affirmed that the tuna melt is supposed to be cold: "it's a tuna salad and comes cold". I pointed out that my fries were cold. The waitress reached over and grabbed one from my plate and said "yeah, it is cold! I'm sorry." She came back later and said that the manager was running to a meeting but would take 10% off for me 'for the inconvenience.' I would have rather had some warm food! I tried to be a good sport and eat it, but it was unappetizing so I left it uneaten. Having to (mostly) pay for the food I did not eat, with not even a token attempt from the restaurant to try and fix it or get me something I liked? Total let down.
ftE8hHJv6cbJ54WJ_9fpdw	Hotels_&_Travel Airlines Transportation 1_star	Cancelled flight at the last minute!!!!! not because of weather, but because of eqipment failure. the agents were very helpful but that doesnt take away the annoyance of "no more flights today".
RLMOOCHGg05SLoTJy_6SpA	Hotels_&_Travel Event_Planning_&_Services Hotels 1_star	Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly. And i informed the manager of it as well. I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail. The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad. But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep. I wouldnt pick this one, the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say. But the Train noise is just unbearable. I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable. Stay Elsewhere. I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail.
mbQaJnR3CvoSRaPJJmh3yw	Mexican Restaurants 1_star	This place is overrated. My taco shell was so greasy, I ordered a taco salad with shredded beef and got big giant hunks of beef. One time was enough for me, won't be back
_lF9ziTxWXxCPPrO2p9U6A	Jazz_&_Blues Arts_&_Entertainment Soul_Food Nightlife Restaurants 1_star	Save your money, gas, and time. Over priced and food took way too long to get to our table. I went once before and it was ok the second time I was sad I spent date Night here with friends. I was embarrassed we suggested this place. You want great chicken go to Lolos in Phoenix! Sorry.
LF6y7jtQ8mgvKSixzV58Kw	Barbeque Restaurants 1_star	I had been looking forward to trying this place out for awhile. However, I shouldn't have. I ordered the brisket and pulled pork dinner and it came with a side, so I ordered mashed potatoes. The meat was below average and didn't taste fresh. The mashed potatoes were not good either. The dinner roll that is used to put the meat on for the pulled pork was the only thing that was decent. I did not care for the bbq sauce. I ordered the cherry cobbler but thew it out after one bite. I do NOT recommend this restaurant. If you want good bbq, go to Little Miss BBQ!
uwl9RZDxPZ_aqGXVg8oPWg	Automotive 1_star	THE BIGGEST SCAM Ever! I went there because I needed a 'cheap' price on a rental. They told me $139.00 and charged me $294.00!!! Go to a real car rental place. 2003 Taurus for $294.00 a week with 160,000 + miles? I could have bought that POS.
hyVbynWMZddEHtSsJ_wVEg	Hotels_&_Travel Car_Rental 1_star	Be very careful! Our trip package included a three day rental at Budget. We decided to opt for insurance as one person driving was not insured. Quoted $50/day for the insurance. Then we were "upgraded" to a midsize car for "only $10 more." When I objected to the ugly old GPS they forced us to take since we already had a new GPS, I was told, "You HAVE to take it. It is included with the package." So you think, an extra $180 isn't great but doable. Then you get your credit card bill which is a whopping $320. When I called to complain, they said that there was a $45 charge for the GPS and $15 for roadside service and a completely insane (like 40%) tax rate. And that I should have declined it if I didn't want it. (Believe me, I tried--they just kept insisting it was included.) My advice--decline everything when renting a car from this company. Or renting a car in Phoenix period.
0U-FyFmTO-0CsZd2aOLl4A	Hotels_&_Travel Car_Rental 1_star	Take a number and wait. I've had a 12+ hour day of training and airline hell, now I get to wait an hour for what will be a substandard rental car. There are 10 rental stations and only 5 CSR's manning them. Horrendous customer service. My company arranged this rental so I have no choice this time. But Budget - especially this location - will never get my personal rental car business.
pXe_LFBmj8kge4mW7nFhLA	Hotels_&_Travel Car_Rental 1_star	Arrived tonight just after our scheduled time and found ourselves grabbing a number like at the dmv. I've come here once before a few years ago and this was not the case. Waited for 45 minutes before getting helped (which for us was 17 tickets being called), and was given a measly response as to why they were the only car rental company in the place with a line like that (we have more cars than everyone else, it's spring training). One woman's job appeared to be shouting out the next number and being rude to the people who couldn't get the ticket thing to work (it stopped working twice while we were waiting and both times she didn't say a word to the very nice people who approached her and said they couldn't grab a number). I went up to ask her a question when they turned off the "cars available" sign and she made me feel super great with her initial slow blink and one word responses. Great choice for customer service! We were assigned a car after the standard up-sell attempts and walked down to the lot to find no car in our spot. Two people in the lot were extremely nice and helpful and got us another car right away but it was done so hastily and without checking with anyone that I wondered if that's what happened to our car in the first place. After being told we would have a full tank of gas and agreed to bringing it back that way, the car was at a solid 3/4 tank. It was bad enough I don't plan on using Budget ever again.
WFnawiqPUaeoHOc9MKlQtg	Print_Media Mass_Media 1_star	The only reason Phoenix New times is still around is because it's free. Their strip club supporters and ads is whats keeping them in business. No one with any common sense would buy Phx new times paper if it was for sale. They call anyone who is against illegal immigration. Bigots. lol The only good story i read on Phx new times is the story about lifelock.com. How it is a scam and that the owners ID was stolen many times. I guess showing your SSN on national TV is a good way to become a victim of ID theft. other than that. story after story about how much they hate Sheriff Joe and all anti illegal people.
EGhZ1Mo1pOWySQS0BiTEQg	Seafood Fish_&_Chips Restaurants 1_star	After months of passing this place and wanting to try their food, we finally made it to KKL. What we weren't expecting from this place was the very pricey menu for fish, shrimp and chips (french fries from a bag, I'm sure)! The shrimp was different and tastey, I had 4 pieces with chips and also a side of mushrooms. Chris had clams, chips and a side of cole slaw and of course we ordered the hushpuppies which everyone raves about. This meal was close to $30 dollars! Some people may feel that isn't bad for lunch at a seafood place, however for the area the food, which isn't like just from the ocean, it's from a bag - it's way too much money and your gut will feel like a grease pit after eating here! My advice, skip this place if you can!
sQgIUDthnMnnL-EAvJwyig	Seafood Fish_&_Chips Restaurants 1_star	Crappy food, servers seem like drug addicts. Crab legs are over priced, precut and frozen. Go elsewhere for seafood.
3T3q9lzhTQUzThz7ZpxvMA	Hotels_&_Travel Airports 1_star	Another poor experience at ole PHX. New to me is that the car rental facility is not on airport property, it's about a 20 minute bus ride which I think is actually in New Mexico. So in addition to my previous observations, you can add another hour to your day if you plan to rent a car. For an international airport, they sure act like a small city airport...
qWz99cn-lMZ6OenSqmHOkw	Hotels_&_Travel Airports 1_star	Got to the security checkpoint and it was a really long line. Then I heard a guy checking bags acting really rude and yelling at us about having to do extra bag checks because we're stupid. So then the line had like 70-100 people in line because they were doing a shift change. The line didn't move for 20 minutes AND a worker came to our side of barriers and started yelling and saying we have too many bags and we don't follow instructions when they scan our items. Worst of all, he told us all that it was our fault if we miiss our flights since we didn't know what we were doing. They took their sweet time, kind of chatting it up during their "shift change. A guy finally said something and the worker got even louder saying that people talk shit to him all day and the customer wasn't going to ruin his day. The regular man didn't say anything but the worker kept going and going. PHX definitely needs to get a hold on the behavior of their employees.... and I almost missed my flight! I made it just in time for final boarding.

Wb9E5F6-QK92bcejFKswlQ	Automotive Car_Dealers 1_star	I have bringing my car here for service every 5000 miles for 4 years. They are consistently slow and give no information as to the progress. Simple service such as an oil change will take up to 4 hours when the car is dropped off first thing in the morning. I will not be coming here for service again. This happens every time.
Nx4rA8fT_UHO7wvzRDnhjQ	Automotive Car_Dealers 1_star	Terrible Service,,,my advice = avoid this dealership at all cost. I took in my Ford vehicle running on it's jump-started dead $120 FORMOCO 100 month warranty battery at age 40 months. No cars in service line, 6+ service advisor's standing around plus the "Service Manager", all doing nothing at 10AM. I was told I would have to wait until late in the day for a mechanic to check battery for $75.00 and if found defective Parts would replace it prorated. I complained that if it was a NAPA, O'Reilly or Walmart, etc. battery it would be checked immediately by any available employee, replaced by same and I'd be on my way. I have done this many times US wide. Nope, No, Nada!! Did I want to wait or get a ride? I said neither!! I removed the battery myself, took it to parts counter where it was exchanged for a new same battery for $58. I replaced my battery and left. ANGRY. What took me 15 minutes was to have taken me about 6 hours because of this Ford Dealer's stupid "policies"...no wonder China is kicking our US Butts. Hello, Ford Motor Co!!!!!!! Goodbye Bell Ford in Phoenix, AZ.
sD_07QF1T2LKiAaSFW-roA	Automotive Car_Dealers 1_star	If they get your phone number you're toast. I've asked to be taken off their list numerous times. Since you can purchase the same vehicle at another Ford dealership, I'd highly recommend doing so.
WZ2ewsyHa4XLTDPo57RqQA	Health_&_Medical Dentists General_Dentistry 1_star	I agree with the first two reviews!!This is the worst dental office ever. The office staff had me leave without a ride after being under gas for three hours. I was found walking north on Tatum full of blood and crying. Thankfully my daughters drove past me (they were going to the dentist office to check on me.) This dentist didn't inform me the consequences of doing full dentures at 37, I suffered from malnutrition as a result from not being able to eat. Still cant eat over a year later. Dentures don't fit. life ruining dentist!
2gKFtTZEwZQqzRF25iNApg	Windows_Installation Home_Services Contractors 1_star	The sales team and pricing were great, they always showed up on time and were very thorough and responsive with my questions. The lead time from when I ordered the windows to installation was minimal and just as they estimated. Unfortunately we just did not have a great experience with the installation. They cut the hardwires of our alarm system in the process of removing the windows, as opposed to just taking the extra 30 seconds to remove the pads attached to the window frames. As a result we had to have the entire house rewired at the cost of $600. True View's response was to tell me that we were responsible for dealing with the alarm beforehand and that it was noted on the second page of the contract (which, for whatever reason, I never received a copy of after I signed, so never had a good chance to sit and read it thoroughly). I see their point and understand that it's probably something I should have thought to prepare for beforehand, but I just find it inexcusable that the installers never questioned it and hastily cut through wires to what was clearly a functioning system without asking me first, when I was there in the house. I also would have appreciated someone mentioning it to me during one of the earlier sales or measuring visits to my home, when I would have had weeks to prepare. On top of that, I was told during the measurement visit that the installers would be bringing insulating spray foam to fill in a nearly 4" gap that would be left around a patio door replacement. When I asked the installation crew, they said they didn't have it with them, and in fact never carried it on their truck as standard practice. So I had to drop everything and quickly run out to buy some myself before they left. I just expected a higher level of service and care from True View, and unfortunately I don't think I'll go back to them for the rest of my window replacement project.
1Mj6Sts0kiDZ7uLnGBFBbw	Windows_Installation Home_Services Contractors 1_star	So far taking four times to fix patio door that they just put new rollers on an had to cut a little off the top. Would not recommend these people unless you want to keep calling them back .
RInP4iN5qk3_pF0lbetYkg	Tires Automotive Wheel_&_Rim_Repair Auto_Parts_&_Supplies 1_star	Very Very Very Bad Service! These guys cannot be trusted. My husband and I bought the tire repair/replacement warranty certificates per tire about a year ago as discount tire recommends. I had a staple in my tire yesterday that created a flat so we went in to have it repaired. The service man said it was not repairable and then proceeded to sell us 2 more tires at a small fee of $500 because of our AWD. He seemed to change his story slightly during our conversation with him so we decided to investigate further if his statements were accurately and WAS our tire really not repairable? First, we found that the tires he was trying to sell us were about 50 bucks cheaper per tire AND we our tire was indeed repairable. Oh I should also mention Mr. discount tire failed to give us back our flat tire and wheel when we returned to pick up our car (after we told him to leave the donut as is). We called the next morning to pick up our tire and wheel and he claimed he threw away the tire but we told him that was not his to throw away and he better find it. Anyway - we got it and took it to another tire company who was able to repair it in 10 minutes, showed me the tire and all the details about it. I can't believe that Discount Tire tried to pull this on us. Well they pulled it on the wrong people and we will not stop here. Other websites and BBB will hear about this. Try just being honest, good service representatives next time Discount Tire!
GEym_SNJXvMx8jN3-HkG4A	Home_Services Real_Estate Apartments 1_star	DO NOT RENT FROM THEM. We were lucky to escape renting from this place and found a better alternative. Our experience through the application process was TERRIBLE. We were told it was a $300 deposit, then a $575 deposit, then a $150 deposit. NO ONE IN THE OFFICE ever knew what they were talking about, which was astonishing since we spoke to a new staff member with every interaction. They were the most unprofessional, unorganized, uneducated bunch that I have ever worked with in my entire life. To top it off, they refused to return $100 fee (towards deposit) after their series of errors. RENT FROM ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

Went in for a routine oil change and came back with a repair order of over $3000 based on the steering. New rack and pinion, shocks, the works. I politely declined and went to get a second estimate elsewhere. I didn't show this second autoshop the quote Advanced Auto gave me. He asked whether I was there because I've been quoted repairs, and showed him the quote. He laughed at it. My car needed none of the repairs I'd been quoted on. He even guessed which auto shop had quoted me before I showed him it was from Advanced Auto Service on Warner street. So my advice is be careful.

Yssteo5LXQrBke9aRcFQeg	Seafood Sushi_Bars Japanese Restaurants 1_star	I think I would like to try the Sakana that everyone else is reviewing because I surely could not have been at the same place... Finding high quality sushi in the Phoenix area has been a challenge for me as most of the places I get referred to are a bit too "Americanized" for my liking. Sakana is thou the worst offender of doing this. My husband and I went the other evening and ordered what we thought were 7 different rolls...nope-they all tasted the same. Fake "krab" minced up and doused in mayo- minced tuna..again doused in mayo-and what didn't have mayo had cream cheese or was deep fried-ick. Even when asking the waitress what was in the rolls (we like to try different things) she at no time said "krab salad"-she just said crab...so when I get rolls that have this stick all minced up with mayo you can certainly understand my frustration. The head chef came over and apologized-however stated that it was their "style" and that's how most of the rolls are. Dinner was atrocious and you leave here with your clothes reeking of oil due to the teppan bar that they have. So money wasted on something I could have done myself with a jar of Hellmans and a package of VandDeKamp Krab and additional money wasted on a dry cleaning bill. Save your palette and your money and go elsewhere if you are looking for good, clean, sushi. If you like all the mayo & cream cheese rolls then this is your spot.
WXpqe1Xnw00WnkgwsK9ncw	Breakfast_&_Brunch Restaurants 1_star	Service was slow; we were in a hurry and had to wait way to long even just to order a drink. The restaurant was nearly empty, and there seemed to be more than enough staff to handle all the tables. Pleeeease please be faster! Not everyone has time to wait around while you take your sweet time! AND the computers were, of course, down so we had to wait even longer to pay. My God, why why WHYYYYYYYYY. -___-
Al7x9m0zmXXoZijrG4QYEQ	American_(Traditional) Restaurants 1_star	Yelp says open till 11:00 pm, arrived at 10:00 pm on Saturday night to empty place and informed that kitchen closed 5 mins ago. Driving 15 minuted with a larger group than in entire restaurant makes me feel that mgmt or owner was not present. If kitchen closes at 10:00 pm, please say that in Yelp :-)
